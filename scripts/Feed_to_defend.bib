abstract = {East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EA group) are a primary food and cash crop for smallholders in Rwanda and much of the East African highlands. Their production generally declines over time due to poor farm management and declining soil fertility. Farmers believe that among the bunch mass maintaining factors, plant density management offers some prospect. They often decrease banana mat (i.e. a single mother plant with interconnected suckers) density in an effort to increase bunch size, but the effectiveness and profitability of this practice has not been studied. In addition, not much research has been executed on the influence of climatic and edaphic factors on variations in on-farm plant density. An on-farm survey was conducted in contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Ruhengeri, Rusizi, Karongi, Butare, Ruhango, Kibungo and Bugesera) to determine existing densities and their relationship to bunch mass. A plant density assessment method was used that measures the average distance of five mats to their respective nearest four mats to calculate average mat spacing. Plant density positively correlated with surplus/deficit water supply (i.e. difference between rainfall and water demand by bananas) (r 2=0.62), with highest plant densities ({\textgreater}1500matsha -1) found in high rainfall areas ({\textgreater}1200mmyr -1) with water surplus (218-508mmyr -1) and lowest plant densities (1000-1400matsha -1) found in lower rainfall areas (1000-1200mmyr -1) with water deficit (from -223 to -119mmyr -1). Heaviest bunches (18.1-20.8kgfreshmassplant -1) were found at lowest plant densities and medium sized bunches (14.7-15.5kg) at highest plant densities. Lower soil and banana leaf nutrient contents (especially N, K, Ca and Mg) were observed on weathered soils (Acrisols) and were associated with smaller bunch mass in comparison to fertile soils (Andosols, Nitisols). Farmers tended to reduce mat densities (i) if they wanted to intercrop bearing in mind site characteristics, and (ii) to increase bunch mass to adapt to market preferences. The plant densities generally recommended by extension bodies (3m×3m or 2m×3m; i.e. 1111 and 1666matsha -1, respectively) are seldom practiced by farmers, nor do they seem to be very appropriate, as higher densities seem productive in areas with high rainfall and relatively good soil fertility. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Banana production landscapes in the African Great Lakes Region (AGLR) have been under immense pressure from Xanthomonas wilt (XW) disease over the past two decades. XW, first reported on banana in central Uganda and eastern DR Congo in 2001, has since spread to the entire AGLR. XW is currently spreading westwards from hot spots in eastern DR Congo highlands, putting the plantain (Musa AAB genome) belt of central and west Africa at risk. In-depth understanding of the key variables responsible for disease spread, current hotspots, and vulnerable landscapes is crucial for disease early warning and management. We mapped aggregated disease distribution and hotspots in the AGLR and identified vulnerable landscapes across African banana production zones. Available data on disease prevalence collected over 11 years was regressed against environmental and expert developed covariates to develop the AGLR XW hotspots map. For the Africa-wide risk map, precipitation, distance to hotspots, degree of trade in fresh banana products, production zone interconnectedness and banana genotype composition were used as covariates. In the AGLR, XW was mainly correlated to precipitation and disease/banana management. Altitude and temperature had unexpectedly low effects, possibly due to an overriding impact of tool-mediated spread which is part of the management covariate. In the AGLR, the eastern part of DR Congo was a large hotspot with highest vulnerability. Apart from endemic zones in the AGLR and Ethiopia, northern Mozambique was perceived as a moderate risk zone mainly due to the predominance of ‘Bluggoe' (Musa ABB type) which is highly susceptible to insect-vectored transmission. Presence of XW hotspots (e.g. eastern DR Congo) and vulnerable areas with low (e.g. north-western Tanzania) or no disease (e.g. Congo basin, western DR Congo and northern Mozambique) pressure suggest key areas where proactive measures e.g. quarantines and information sharing on XW diagnosis, epidemiology, and control could be beneficial.},

abstract = {The decline of cooking banana production in parts of East Africa has been associated with a loss of soil fertility and increased pest pressure. Previous work indicated that the use of mineral fertilizers at recommended rates is not financially viable on plantations where pest pressure is high. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of half the recommended rates of mineral fertilizers and organic mulch on banana yield, soil and foliar nutrient status, soil water and pest damage in the central region of Uganda. The study was conducted in a four-year old banana plantation infested with weevils. Treatments consisted of mineral fertilizer alone, mulch alone, a combination of mulch with fertilizer, and a control (no mulch from outside the plot, or mineral fertilizer applied). Fruit yield was generally low (mean of 7.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and increases above the control ranged from 1.1 to 2.0 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Banana yield was significantly higher in the sole mulch treatment than in the control. However, there were no significant differences in yield among the treatments that received external inputs. Thus, there was no demonstrable yield advantage of combining mineral fertilizer with mulch. At the end of the trial, soil K concentrations in the two treatments that were mulched, were almost twice those of the control, but this difference was not statistically significant. Concentrations of Ca and Mg did not differ with treatment. Soil available P significantly increased when mineral fertilizer and organic mulch were combined. Treatments that received organic mulch were lower in foliar concentrations of N and Mg, and higher in K. Soil water content was greater in the surface soil layer in the treatments that received mulch, presumably due to less surface run-off and evaporation, since there was no change in surface soil porosity. The effect of organic and inorganic amendments had no impact on weevil damage, which remained above 5{\%} at the end of the trial. We conclude that where weevil damage is over 5{\%} of the cross section near the collar, banana production may not be economically increased through use of either mineral fertilizer and/or organic mulch.},

abstract = {Poor yields of East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EAHB) on smallholder farms have often been attributed to problems of poor soil fertility. We measured the effects of mineral fertilizers on crop performance at two sites over two to three crop cycles; Kawanda in central Uganda and Ntungamo in southwest Uganda. Fertilizers were applied at rates of 0N-50P-600K, 150N-50P-600K, 400N-0P-600K, 400N-50P-0K, 400N-50P-250K and 400N-50P-600K kg ha-1 yr-1. In addition 60Mg-6Zn-0.5Mo-1B kg ha-1 yr-1 was applied to all treatments, with the exception of the control plots which received no fertilizer. Fresh bunch mass and yield increased with successive cycles. Yield increases above the control ranged from 3.1 to 6.2 kg bunch-1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 11.5 kg bunch-1) and 2.2-11.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (average yield for all treatments 15.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1) at Kawanda, compared with 12.4-16.0 kg bunch-1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 14.7 kg bunch-1) and 7.0-29.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (average yield for all treatments 17.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1) at Ntungamo. The limiting nutrients at both sites were in the order K {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} N. Potassium, N and P foliar nutrient mass fractions were below previously established Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) norms, with the smallest K mass fractions observed in the best yielding plots at Ntungamo. Total nutrient uptakes (K {\textgreater} N {\textgreater} P) were higher at Ntungamo as compared with Kawanda, probably due to better soil moisture availability and root exploration of the soil. Average N, P and K conversion efficiencies for two crop cycles at both sites amounted to 49.2 kg finger DM kg-1 N, 587 kg finger DM kg-1 P and 10.8 kg finger DM kg-1 K. Calibration results of the model QUEFTS using data from Ntungamo were reasonable (R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 648 kg ha-1). Using the measured soil chemical properties and yield data from an experiment at Mbarara in southwest Uganda, the calibrated QUEFTS model predicted yields well (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 562 kg ha-1). We conclude that banana yields can be increased by use of mineral fertilizers, but fertilizer recovery efficiencies need to improve substantially before promoting wide-scale adoption. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The cultivation of plantain and cooking banana in humid areas of Uganda continues to grow in importance as rural population densities increase and as demand from urban areas intensifies. Difficulties accompany this importance, particularly soil depletion and intensification of pests and diseases of banana. We interviewed 510 farm families practising banana-based cultivation in six districts along the Lake Victoria Basin of southern-central Uganda to determine which resource management strategies are undertaken to mitigate limitations to banana cultivation and the importance of livestock and intercropping within those systems. Of the farmers interviewed, 97{\%} reapply banana stalks and leaves to the banana mats on pruning and upon harvest, a practice that may contribute to banana weevil, stem nematode and sigatoka fungal attacks. Banana stalks were also applied as mulches to cash (4{\%}) and field crops (2{\%}) and used as livestock feed (10{\%}). Farmers applied a wide range of additional resources to bananas including field crop residues (81{\%}), burned residues (3{\%}), on-farm manures (31{\%}), compost (16{\%}), external organic (17{\%}) and chemical (4{\%}) inputs. Of the organic inputs applied to bananas, bean trash (72{\%}), maize stover (68{\%}), cattle manure (45{\%}) and composts (18{\%}) were most frequently applied. It was necessary to consider at least five different organic inputs to account for more than 90{\%} of farmer practices. Overall, intercropping was practised by 69{\%} of the farmers. The six most encountered intercrops were, in decreasing order, beans, maize, cassava, Ficus nataliensis and fruit trees. When organic matter management was separated into five general categories depending on the reliance upon bananas, other crops, manures and composts as organic additions to soils, significant differences in reported average bunch weights were obtained. The farmers applying banana stalks, field crop residues and cattle manures reported the largest bunch weights (20.3 kg per bunch). Farmers relying upon banana stalks alone, banana stalks with field crop residues and either small livestock manure or domestic compost reported the lowest yields (13.1, 14.3 and 12.9 kg per bunch, respectively). We conclude that farmers are developing strategies to resist fertility depletion, in part through better recycling of on-farm resources and intercropping but greater reliance upon external inputs may be required to ameliorate declining banana yields.},

abstract = {The Plant Vigor Hypothesis (PVH) predicts an oviposition preference of females and higher offspring performance for insect herbivores on longer and fast-growing plant modules. We tested the PVH predictions by investigating the effects of leaf size of Miconia prasina (Sw.) DC. (Melastomataceae) on the oviposition preference and on the offspring survival of the gall-inducing weevil Prospoliata bicolorata (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Additionally, we analysed the effects of top-down mortality force on this system. Approximately 83{\%} of the developed galls resulted in adults of P. bicolorata, whereas 17{\%} of the galls successfully induced were killed by natural enemies (top-down effect). Leaves of intermediate size were more abundant while smaller and longer leaves were rare. Nevertheless, the percentage of P. bicolorata galls was higher on the smallest leaves of M. prasina, refuting the preference prediction of the PVH. Our results also refuted the performance prediction: the ratio of survival per leaf was negatively related to the leaf length. Thus, we found a link between female preference and larval performance of P. bicolorata on small-sized leaves of M. prasina. The next goal is to understand the mechanisms involved in the selection of gall-inducing weevil on short leaves of its host plant.},

abstract = {The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development.},

abstract = {Farmers practising banana-based (Musa spp.) cultivation in the title region were interviewed to determine which resource management strategies were undertaken to mitigate limitations to banana cultivation (soil depletion and intensification of pests and diseases) and the importance of livestock and intercropping within those systems. Of the farmers interviewed, 97{\%} re-applied banana stalks and leaves to the banana mats on pruning and upon harvest, a practice that may contribute to banana weevil [Cosmopolites sordidus], stem nematode and sigatoka fungal attacks. Banana stalks were also applied as mulches to cash (4{\%}) and field crops (2{\%}) and used as livestock feed (10{\%}). Farmers applied a wide range of additional resources to bananas including field crop residues (81{\%}), burned residues (3{\%}), on-farm manures (31{\%}), compost (16{\%}), external organic (17{\%}) and chemical (4{\%}) inputs. Of the organic inputs applied, bean trash (72{\%}), maize stover (68{\%}), cattle manure (45{\%}) and composts (18{\%}) were the most frequent. It was necessary to consider at least five different organic inputs to account for {\textgreater}90{\%} of farmer practices. Overall, intercropping was practised by 69{\%} of farmers. The six most encountered intercrops were, in decreasing order, beans, maize, cassava, Ficus natalensis, and fruit trees. Farmers applying banana stalks, field crop residues and cattle manures reported the largest bunch weights. Farmers relying upon banana stalks alone, banana stalks with field crop residues and either small livestock manure or domestic compost reported the lowest yields. It was concluded that farmers were developing strategies to resist fertility depletion, in part through better recycling of on-farm resources and intercropping but greater reliance upon external inputs may be required to ameliorate declining banana yields.},

Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.},

abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a region beset with challenges, not least its ability to feed itself. Low agricultural productivity, exploding populations, and escalating urbanization have led to declining per capita food availability. In order to reverse this trend, crop production systems must intensify, which brings with it an elevated threat from pests and diseases, including plant-parasitic nematodes. A holistic systems approach to pest management recognizes disciplinary integration. However, a critical under-representation of nematol-ogy expertise is a pivotal shortcoming, especially given the magnitude of the threat nematodes pose under more intensified systems. With more volatile climates, efficient use of water by healthy root systems is especially crucial. Within SSA, smallholder farming systems dominate the agricultural},

abstract = {Low yields of East African highland bananas (Musa spp. AAA-EA) are often attributed to poor and declining soil fertility, which outweighs other biophysical factors and management practices. We investigated the influence of planting density on nutrient mass fractions and nutrient imbalance indices in bananas under small-scale, low-input systems using the compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND) approach. Boundary line functions were developed to identify yield limiting factors and quantify their contribution to the yield gap. Soil, plant, yield and water data were collected in plant density experiments conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (i.e. Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall but low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility). Effects of site×cultivar and site×density on bunch yield were significant (p{\textless}0.05). Annual yields (tha-1yr-1) ranged from 6.1 to 9.2 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 at Ruhengeri. Similar trends were registered for the above ground dry matter yield. CND indices showed that K, Mg and P were the most deficient elements in areas with low inherent soil fertility (Kibungo and Rubona). The yield gap analysis also confirmed that K was the most limiting factor, contributing to a predicted yield gap of 55.3{\%} at Kibungo while P and Mg collectively contributed to a 35{\%} yield gap at Rubona. An increase in plant density resulted in an increase in average yield gap from 45.6 to 70.2{\%} at Kibungo, whilst the average yield gap decreased significantly with increases in plant density from 47.5 to 30.2{\%} at Rubona and 76.6 to 53.7{\%} at Ruhengeri. The study confirmed that soil fertility is a more limiting factor than water, but both CND norms and boundary line analysis showed that predicted yield gaps seem to be higher for plant density than soil fertility. Therefore, plant density management is an entry point to optimize yield of East African highland bananas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Weevils were released at the base of banana mats 9 months after planting. Weevil populations, corm damage, plant growth and yield were assessed over four crop cycles. The effect of damage was greater on bunch weight than on plant growth and rate of development. Yield loss increased with crop cycle and ranged from 5{\%} in the first cycle to 44{\%} in the fourth cycle. The cumulative effect of heavy damage sustained over several crop cycles resulted in greater reduction in bunch weight than that inflicted by similar levels of damage in a single cycle.

Foliar analysis by the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) pinpoints K and Mg as the most limiting nutrients. This study tested the effects of K and Mg additions on plant performance and weevil damage for 2.75 yr, at Buligwe in central Uganda and Muyogo in southwest Uganda. All treatments received 25 kg P ha-1 and 100 kg N ha-1 annually, while K and Mg were applied (kg ha-1) at 0 K-0 Mg, 100 K-0 Mg, 100 K-25 Mg and 100 K-50 Mg. Fresh fruit yields (Mg ha-1 yr-1) ranged from 3.2 to 5.0 at Buligwe and 14.4 to 18.9 at Muyogo, with similar treatment trends at both sites. The 100 K-0 Mg treatment produced higher yields than no-K control (p=0.022 for the combined dataset). Yields with K+Mg tended to be lower than with K only, though not significantly different. Foliar nutrient concentrations were little affected by treatments, but varied substantially among sample dates. With increasing cumulative rainfall between foliar samplings, foliar P declined (p=0.077), K declined (ns), and Ca and Mg increased (p=0.02 to 0.03). Weevil damage was higher at Buligwe, but was little affected by K and Mg treatments at either site.},

abstract = {In banana on-farm studies in the East African Highlands, quantification of production has been difficult because plants are at different stages of development at any given time. Production is continuous and quantification would therefore require permanent presence of an observer. Hence, most on-farm surveys have resorted to estimations from farmers or 'experts' through recall or visual qualitative observations. These methods are highly inaccurate. This study aims to develop and validate allometric relationships for quantitative estimation of bunch weights, based on rapid, inexpensive and non-destructive methods of data collection that take into consideration genotypic, spatial and developmental variability. The study was conducted in 179 farmer fields in central, south, southwest, and east Uganda. Bunch weights were estimated through linear regression with log-transformed girth of pseudostem at base and 1m, number of hands, and number of fingers in the lower row of the second lowest hand. The number of hands and fingers relate to the potential sink size (i.e. bunch), and the girth at base and 1m were used as a proxy for pseudostem volume, which relates to the potential of the plant to fill the sink. Bunch weight was significantly (P ??? 0.001) and positively (R2 = 0.73) related to log-transformed pseudostem volume, and number of hands and fingers. When data were partitioned and regressed, regression coefficients did not differ significantly for cultivars (i.e. Enyeru, Kibuzi, Nakabululu and Nakitembe), developmental stages (flowering, early fruiting, late fruiting and full maturity), regions (central, south, southwest and east Uganda), foliar and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. Data partitioning improved the accuracy of prediction significantly for different cultivars, regions, and foliar Ca, but not for bunch developmental stages, foliar N, P, K and Mg and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. However, the residuals of all the regressions of partitioned data correlated highly (R2 between 0.92 and 1.00) to those of the regression based on pooled data. On validation of the regression based on pooled data, the bias (-9.97{\%}) and modeling efficiency statistic (0.64), suggested that predictions were not always accurate. Still, the total predicted bunch weights were higher than the observed bunch weight by only 2{\%}. This study therefore concludes that the regression derived using pooled data is suitable for on-farm prediction of bunch weight, for the East African Highland cooking banana, regardless of genotypic, developmental and spatial variations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The study aimed to quantify the relative contributions of soil fertility factors (S), pests and diseases (P) and crop management practices (M) to highland banana (Musa spp. AAA-EA) yields under heterogeneous on-farm conditions. Soil status, nutrient levels, pests, crop management from 150 mats within close (CH), mid (MH) and remote (RH) distances of 10 homesteads in Butare, Southwest Uganda were monitored from 2006-2008. Actual yields (14.3 Mg ha-1 yr-1) of dominant cultivar (cv. ‘Enyeru') were limited by S (62.8{\%}), P (22.0{\%}) and M factors (15.2{\%}). Bunch mass was limited by low soil pH ({\textless} 6.2), low exch. Ca ({\textless} 2.04 cmol+kg-1), Mg ({\textless} 2.3 cmol+kg-1), high K:Mg ratio (0.99±1.2), mat density ({\textgreater} 1512 mats ha-1) and excessive defoliation ({\textless} 9 functional leaves) from boundary line analysis. DRIS norms of exchangeable bases were low relative to N, P {\&} K. Banana weevil and nematode damages contributed 21.7{\%} and 3.3{\%} of yield limitations, respectively. Most S factors limited yields in ‘fertile' CH (75{\%}) and P factors in MH and RH which differed with household resource endowment. Spatial variability in biophysical factors within small farms is so large and should be considered when addressing yield limitations to highland banana yields},

abstract = {Banana is the primary food crop in Uganda, but yields are low due to a complex of abiotic and biotic constraints. However, quantitative information on the importance, interactions, and geographic distribution of yields and constraints is scanty. We monitored yields, biotic and abiotic constraints in 159 plots in Central, South and Southwest Uganda in 2006-2007. About half the plots were on-farm demonstrations that received fertilizer (average 71N, 8P, 32 K kg ha-1 year-1) through a development project, the rest were ordinary farmer fields (i.e. controls). Fresh banana yields in controls were significantly (P ??? 0.05) higher in Southwest (20 t ha-1 year-1) compared with Central (12 t ha-1 year-1) and South (10 t ha-1 year-1). Demonstrations yielded 3-10 t ha-1 year-1 more than controls. Yield losses were calculated using the boundary line approach. In Central, yield losses, expressed as percentage of attainable yield, were mainly attributed to pests (nematodes 10{\%} loss, weevils - 6{\%}) and suboptimal crop management (mulch 25{\%}). In South, poor soil quality (pH - 21{\%}, SOM - 13{\%}, N-total - 13{\%}, and Clay - 11{\%}) and suboptimal crop management (weeds - 20{\%}) were the main constraints. In Southwest, suboptimal crop management (mulch 16{\%}), poor soil quality (K/(Ca + Mg) - 11{\%}) and low rainfall (5{\%}) were the primary constraints. The study revealed that biotic stresses (i.e. pests, weeds) are particularly important in Central, whereas abiotic stresses (i.e. nutrient deficiencies, drought) dominate in South and Southwest. This study concludes that (i) technologies currently available allow farmers to double yields and (ii) past research efforts have mistakenly neglected abiotic constraints. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Banana is the most important food crop in Uganda. However, there has been a decline in productivity, attributed to declining soil fertility, drought, pests and diseases and crop management factors. This study aimed to explore the possibility of increasing yields through the use of fertilizer and mulch, and to evaluate the benefits of these inputs across the major banana producing regions in Uganda. This study was carried out in 179 smallholder plots in Central, South, Southwest and East Uganda in 2006/7. Half of the plots were 'demonstration plots' of an agricultural development project, while the other half were neighboring farmer plots that acted as 'control'. Demonstration plots received mineral fertilizer (100{\%} of plots), averaging 71 N, 8 P, 32 K kg ha-1 yr-1 and external mulch from grass and crop residues (64{\%} of plots), whereas control plots received no mineral fertilizer and little external mulch (26{\%} of plots). Demonstration plots had significantly (P{\textless}=0.05) higher yields than control plot in Central, South and Southwest, but average yield increases varied from 4.8 t ha-1 yr-1 (Southwest) to 8.0 (Central), and 10.0 (South). Average weevil corm damage (3{\%}) and nematode-induced root necrosis (7{\%}) was low and similar for both plot types, so yield increases could only be explained by the use of fertilizer and mulch. The highest demonstration plot yield increases were observed where fertilizer addressed key nutrient deficiencies identified using the compositional nutrient diagnosis approach. Farm gate bunch prices declined from 0.17 (Central Uganda) to 0.07 USD kg-1 (Southwest Uganda). Consequently, average marginal rate of return (MRR) of fertilizer and mulch use ranged from 0.1 (Southwest) to 5.8 (Central). The technologies were likely to be acceptable to farmers (MRR{\textgreater}=1.00) up to 160 km away from the capital. Fertilizer use is likely to be acceptable in all regions (MRR=0.7-9.4) if local fertilizer prices of 2006/7 (average USD 0.56 kg-1 of fertilizer) declined by 50{\%}. Doubling of fertilizer prices is likely to make fertilizer use unacceptable beyond 100 km away from the capital. The study concludes that there is scope for increased input use in banana systems in Uganda, but that regional variations in crop response, input/output prices, and price fluctuations have to be taken into account.},

abstract = {Although drought stress has been identified among the production constraints of East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EA genome), no quantitative data were available to support this assumption. This study uses data from three on-station fertilizer trials (5-6 cycles) in Central and Southwest Uganda to quantify the effect of drought stress on banana production and explore possible interactions with nutrient availability. Production data were collected at individual plant basis from 1996 to 2002 in one trial and from 2004 to 2009 in two trials. Cumulative rainfall in the 12 months before harvest (CRF12) was computed per plant from daily rainfall measurements. Average bunch weight ranged from 8.0 to 21.9 kg between trials and cycles and was 8-28{\%} less in dry (CRF12{\textless}=905 mm) than in normal (905{\textless}CRF12{\textless}=1365 mm) rainfall periods. Linear relations were observed between CRF12 and maximum bunch weight over the whole range of observed CRF12 (500-1750 mm), whereby every 100 mm decline in rainfall caused maximum bunch weight losses of 1.5-3.1 kg or 8-10{\%}. Optimum annual rainfall for East African highland bananas may thus be well above 1200-1300 mm yr-1 as suggested earlier. Relative drought-induced yield losses were independent of soil fertility. Absolute losses on fertile/fertilized soils were similar to those recorded in well fertilized irrigation studies in Latin America. Our study suggests that drought-induced yield losses in areas of the East African highlands with annual rainfall {\textless}1100 mm are perhaps as high as 20-65{\%} compared to the wetter areas in this region. To improve productivity of smallholder banana farmers in Africa, more attention should be given to research geared towards improved water/drought stress management.},
