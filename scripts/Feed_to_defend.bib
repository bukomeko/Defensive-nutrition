abstract = {The Plant Vigor Hypothesis (PVH) predicts an oviposition preference of females and higher offspring performance for insect herbivores on longer and fast-growing plant modules. We tested the PVH predictions by investigating the effects of leaf size of Miconia prasina (Sw.) DC. (Melastomataceae) on the oviposition preference and on the offspring survival of the gall-inducing weevil Prospoliata bicolorata (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Additionally, we analysed the effects of top-down mortality force on this system. Approximately 83{\%} of the developed galls resulted in adults of P. bicolorata, whereas 17{\%} of the galls successfully induced were killed by natural enemies (top-down effect). Leaves of intermediate size were more abundant while smaller and longer leaves were rare. Nevertheless, the percentage of P. bicolorata galls was higher on the smallest leaves of M. prasina, refuting the preference prediction of the PVH. Our results also refuted the performance prediction: the ratio of survival per leaf was negatively related to the leaf length. Thus, we found a link between female preference and larval performance of P. bicolorata on small-sized leaves of M. prasina. The next goal is to understand the mechanisms involved in the selection of gall-inducing weevil on short leaves of its host plant.},

abstract = {East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EA group) are a primary food and cash crop for smallholders in Rwanda and much of the East African highlands. Their production generally declines over time due to poor farm management and declining soil fertility. Farmers believe that among the bunch mass maintaining factors, plant density management offers some prospect. They often decrease banana mat (i.e. a single mother plant with interconnected suckers) density in an effort to increase bunch size, but the effectiveness and profitability of this practice has not been studied. In addition, not much research has been executed on the influence of climatic and edaphic factors on variations in on-farm plant density. An on-farm survey was conducted in contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Ruhengeri, Rusizi, Karongi, Butare, Ruhango, Kibungo and Bugesera) to determine existing densities and their relationship to bunch mass. A plant density assessment method was used that measures the average distance of five mats to their respective nearest four mats to calculate average mat spacing. Plant density positively correlated with surplus/deficit water supply (i.e. difference between rainfall and water demand by bananas) (r 2=0.62), with highest plant densities ({\textgreater}1500matsha -1) found in high rainfall areas ({\textgreater}1200mmyr -1) with water surplus (218-508mmyr -1) and lowest plant densities (1000-1400matsha -1) found in lower rainfall areas (1000-1200mmyr -1) with water deficit (from -223 to -119mmyr -1). Heaviest bunches (18.1-20.8kgfreshmassplant -1) were found at lowest plant densities and medium sized bunches (14.7-15.5kg) at highest plant densities. Lower soil and banana leaf nutrient contents (especially N, K, Ca and Mg) were observed on weathered soils (Acrisols) and were associated with smaller bunch mass in comparison to fertile soils (Andosols, Nitisols). Farmers tended to reduce mat densities (i) if they wanted to intercrop bearing in mind site characteristics, and (ii) to increase bunch mass to adapt to market preferences. The plant densities generally recommended by extension bodies (3m×3m or 2m×3m; i.e. 1111 and 1666matsha -1, respectively) are seldom practiced by farmers, nor do they seem to be very appropriate, as higher densities seem productive in areas with high rainfall and relatively good soil fertility. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Otolith chemistry has become a key tool to identify and delineate fish stock units. Its successful application as a natural tag in stock discrimination studies is based on the ability to distinguish among different groups due to variation in otolith chemical composition. Here, we briefly summarize the history and the development of otolith chemistry in general and their application in stock delineation studies in particular. A short overview of the major achievements in stock identification using otolith chemistry is provided whilst covering the evolution in methodological and analytical approaches over the last decades. Current and future challenges and research gaps are outlined focusing on the need to provide accurate stock structure estimates for management purposes. Overall, there is still large room for improvement regarding how we overcome these challenges and supersede the current gaps in population structure and connectivity studies using otolith chemistry. The most favorable and practical directions for future research are discussed, and include marker integration, new technological and statistical approaches that may contribute in further advancing otolith chemistry and its application in stock delineation. Ultimately, the continued development of holistic approaches combining otolith chemistry with different and potentially complementary techniques is clearly the course of action to promote interconnection between management actions and biological processes, and unambiguously resolve stock structure and scientifically underpin fisheries management.},

abstract = {Banana is the most important food crop in Uganda. However, there has been a decline in productivity, attributed to declining soil fertility, drought, pests and diseases and crop management factors. This study aimed to explore the possibility of increasing yields through the use of fertilizer and mulch, and to evaluate the benefits of these inputs across the major banana producing regions in Uganda. This study was carried out in 179 smallholder plots in Central, South, Southwest and East Uganda in 2006/7. Half of the plots were 'demonstration plots' of an agricultural development project, while the other half were neighboring farmer plots that acted as 'control'. Demonstration plots received mineral fertilizer (100{\%} of plots), averaging 71 N, 8 P, 32 Kkgha-1yr-1 and external mulch from grass and crop residues (64{\%} of plots), whereas control plots received no mineral fertilizer and little external mulch (26{\%} of plots). Demonstration plots had significantly (P{\textless}0.05) higher yields than control plot in Central, South and Southwest, but average yield increases varied from 4.8tha-1yr-1 (Southwest) to 8.0 (Central), and 10.0 (South). Average weevil corm damage (3{\%}) and nematode-induced root necrosis (7{\%}) was low and similar for both plot types, so yield increases could only be explained by the use of fertilizer and mulch. The highest demonstration plot yield increases were observed where fertilizer addressed key nutrient deficiencies identified using the compositional nutrient diagnosis approach. Farm gate bunch prices declined from 0.17 (Central Uganda) to 0.07 USDkg-1 (Southwest Uganda). Consequently, average marginal rate of return (MRR) of fertilizer and mulch use ranged from 0.1 (Southwest) to 5.8 (Central). The technologies were likely to be acceptable to farmers (MRR{\textgreater}1.00) up to 160km away from the capital. Fertilizer use is likely to be acceptable in all regions (MRR=0.7-9.4) if local fertilizer prices of 2006/7 (average USD 0.56kg-1 of fertilizer) declined by 50{\%}. Doubling of fertilizer prices is likely to make fertilizer use unacceptable beyond 100km away from the capital. The study concludes that there is scope for increased input use in banana systems in Uganda, but that regional variations in crop response, input/output prices, and price fluctuations have to be taken into account. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Foliar analysis by the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) pinpoints K and Mg as the most limiting nutrients. This study tested the effects of K and Mg additions on plant performance and weevil damage for 2.75 yr, at Buligwe in central Uganda and Muyogo in southwest Uganda. All treatments received 25 kg P ha-1 and 100 kg N ha-1 annually, while K and Mg were applied (kg ha-1) at 0 K-0 Mg, 100 K-0 Mg, 100 K-25 Mg and 100 K-50 Mg. Fresh fruit yields (Mg ha -1 yr-1) ranged from 3.2 to 5.0 at Buligwe and 14.4 to 18.9 at Muyogo, with similar treatment trends at both sites. The 100 K-0 Mg treatment produced higher yields than no-K control (p = 0.022 for the combined dataset). Yields with K+Mg tended to be lower than with K only, though not significantly different. Foliar nutrient concentrations were little affected by treatments, but varied substantially among sample dates. With increasing cumulative rainfall between foliar samplings, foliar P declined (p = 0.077), K declined (ns), and Ca and Mg increased (p = 0.02 to 0.03). Weevil damage was higher at Buligwe, but was little affected by K and Mg treatments at either site.},

abstract = {The cultivation of plantain and cooking banana in humid areas of Uganda continues to grow in importance as rural population densities increase and as demand from urban areas intensifies. Difficulties accompany this importance, particularly soil depletion and intensification of pests and diseases of banana. We interviewed 510 farm families practising banana-based cultivation in six districts along the Lake Victoria Basin of southern-central Uganda to determine which resource management strategies are undertaken to mitigate limitations to banana cultivation and the importance of livestock and intercropping within those systems. Of the farmers interviewed, 97{\%} reapply banana stalks and leaves to the banana mats on pruning and upon harvest, a practice that may contribute to banana weevil, stem nematode and sigatoka fungal attacks. Banana stalks were also applied as mulches to cash (4{\%}) and field crops (2{\%}) and used as livestock feed (10{\%}). Farmers applied a wide range of additional resources to bananas including field crop residues (81{\%}), burned residues (3{\%}), on-farm manures (31{\%}), compost (16{\%}), external organic (17{\%}) and chemical (4{\%}) inputs. Of the organic inputs applied to bananas, bean trash (72{\%}), maize stover (68{\%}), cattle manure (45{\%}) and composts (18{\%}) were most frequently applied. It was necessary to consider at least five different organic inputs to account for more than 90{\%} of farmer practices. Overall, intercropping was practised by 69{\%} of the farmers. The six most encountered intercrops were, in decreasing order, beans, maize, cassava, Ficus nataliensis and fruit trees. When organic matter management was separated into five general categories depending on the reliance upon bananas, other crops, manures and composts as organic additions to soils, significant differences in reported average bunch weights were obtained. The farmers applying banana stalks, field crop residues and cattle manures reported the largest bunch weights (20.3 kg per bunch). Farmers relying upon banana stalks alone, banana stalks with field crop residues and either small livestock manure or domestic compost reported the lowest yields (13.1, 14.3 and 12.9 kg per bunch, respectively). We conclude that farmers are developing strategies to resist fertility depletion, in part through better recycling of on-farm resources and intercropping but greater reliance upon external inputs may be required to ameliorate declining banana yields.},

abstract = {Nutrition concerns the chemicals required by organism for its growth, tissue maintenance, reproduction and necessary to maintain these functions. It may determine resistance or susceptibility to pests. Among several plant nutrients, only 17 are essential for proper growth and development of plants and each nutrient plays important role in their growth. These nutrients are required by insects for their growth, tissue maintenance, reproduction and energy. They fulfill their requirements through feeding on plants. Nitrogen has positive effects on individual insect performance, probably due to deposition-induced improvements in host plant chemistry. These improvements include increased nitrogen and decreased carbon-based defensive compound concentrations. Potassium provides high resistance against insect-pests. High levels of potassium enhance secondary compound metabolism, reduce carbohydrate accumulation and plant damage from insect pests. Phosphorus also decreases the host suitability to various insect-pests. Secondary macronutrients and micronutrients like calcium, zinc and sulphur also reduce the pest populations. Among mineral elements, silicon is involved in plant resistance against insect pest damage. The indirect effects of fertilization practices acting through changes in the nutrient composition of the crop have been reported to influence plant resistance to many insect pests. The need for more healthful foods is stimulating the development of techniques to increase plant resistance to phytophagous insects. 1. Introduction Terrestrial eukaryotic biodiversity is dominated by plants and the animals that eat them, the majority of which are insects (Simpson et al. 2015) [23]. Insect-pests are threat to agricultural productivity. They affect the crop yield, quality and aesthetic value. Nutritional quality of plant tissue is one of the main characteristics of host plant selection by phytophagous insects (Bernays and Chapman 1994) [6]. It has a substantial impact on the predisposition of plants to insect-pests. Unlike in human nutrition where the effect of nutrition on "health" has gained considerable importance, the implementation of "healthy" nutrition to improve resistance and tolerance of plants lags its potential. Plant nutrition is a study that deals with plants' need for certain chemical elements including their specific and interactive effects on all aspects of plant growth and development, their availability, absorption, transport, and utilization. These chemical elements are referred to as plant nutrients. A plant nutrient is a chemical element that is essential for plant growth and reproduction. Essential element is a term often used to identify a plant nutrient. Plant nutrients can be classified on the basis of mineral composition, nutrients concentration and on the basis of their physiological functions. Besides carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which plants obtain from carbon dioxide and water, 14 nutrients are recognized as essential viz., primary macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), secondary macronutrients (calcium, magnesium and sulphur) and micronutrients (iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, molybdenum, chlorine and nickel) for growth of plants. The relative availability of various nutrients affects the growth and fitness of herbivores, whose biomass generally contains much greater concentrations of elements as compared to plants (Boswell et al. 2008) [7]. Qualitative nutritional requirements of insects include carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals and vitamins. Insects get their nutrients from plants through feeding.},

abstract = {This study examined the effects of various levels of nitrogen inputs (optimal, insufficient and excessive) and water inputs (optimal, low drought and high drought) to tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) on survival and development of an invasive tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meytick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Plant growth i.e. plant height and the number of nodes declined under insufficient or excessive nitrogen treatment. Compared to optimal N, insufficient N treatment decreased leaf N content and increased the carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) whereas an excess of N had no effect on both leaf N content and leaf C/N ratio. Sub-optimal nitrogen supplies, water treatments and their interactions, significantly reduced the leafminer survival rate and slowed down its development. Together with the findings from three recent companion studies, we assumed that a combination of changes in nutritional value and chemical defense could explain these observed effects. Furthermore, our findings supported both the "Plant vigor hypothesis" and the "Nitrogen limitation hypothesis".},

abstract = {East African highland bananas (EAHB) were regarded as sterile. Their screening for female fertility with “Calcutta 4” as male parent revealed that 37 EAHB were fertile. This was the foundation for the establishment of the EAHB crossbreeding programs by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) in Uganda in the mid-1990s. The aim of this study was to assess the progress and efficiency of the EAHB breeding program at IITA, Sendusu in Uganda. Data on pollinations, seeds generated and germinated, plus hybrids selected between 1995 and 2015 were analyzed. Pollination success and seed germination percentages for different cross combinations were calculated. The month of pollination did not result in significantly different (P = 0.501) pollination success. Musa acuminata subsp. malaccensis accession 250 had the highest pollination success (66.8{\%}), followed by the cultivar “Rose” (66.6{\%}) among the diploid males. Twenty-five EAHB out of 41 studied for female fertility produced up to 305 seeds per pollinated bunch, and were therefore deemed fertile. The percentage of seed germination varied among crosses: 26{\%} for 2x × 4x, 23{\%} for 2x × 2x, 11{\%} for 3x × 2x, and 7{\%} for 4x × 2x. Twenty-seven NARITA hybrids (mostly secondary triploids ensuing from the 4x × 2x) were selected for further evaluation in the East African region. One so far –“NARITA 7”– was officially released to farmers in Uganda. Although pollination of EAHB can be conducted throughout the year, the seed set and germination is low. Thus, further research on pollination conditions and optimization of embryo culture protocols should be done to boost seed set and embryo germination, respectively. More research in floral biology and seed germination as well as other breeding strategies are required to increase the efficiency of the EAHB breeding program.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition has shifted many ecosystems from nitrogen (N) limitation to phosphorus (P) limitation. Although well documented in plants, no study to date has explored whether N deposition exacerbates P limitation at higher trophic levels, or focused on the effects of induced plant P limitation on trophic interactions. Insect herbivores exhibit strict N : P homeostasis, and should therefore be very sensitive to variations in plant N : P stoichiometry and prone to experiencing deposition-induced P limitation. In the current study, we investigated the effects of N deposition and P availability on a plant-herbivorous insect system. Using common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and two of its specialist herbivores, the monarch caterpillar (Danaus plexippus) and milkweed aphid (Aphis asclepiadis) as our study system, we found that experimental N deposition caused P limitation in milkweed plants, but not in either insect species. However, the mechanisms for the lack of P limitation were different for each insect species. The body tissues of A. asclepiadis always exhibited higher N : P ratios than that of the host plant, suggesting that the N demand of this species exceeds P demand, even under high N deposition levels. For D. plexippus, P addition increased the production of latex, which is an important defense negatively affecting D. plexippus growth rate. As a result, we illustrate that P limitation of herbivores is not an inevitable consequence of anthropogenic N deposition in terrestrial systems. Rather, species-specific demands for nutrients and the defensive responses of plants combine to determine the responses of herbivores to P availability under N deposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that plants supplied with organic fertilizers are better defended against insect herbivores than those supplied with synthetic fertilizers was tested over two field seasons. Organic and synthetic fertilizer treatments at two nitrogen concentrations were supplied to Brassica plants, and their effects on the abundance of herbivore species and plant chemistry were assessed. The organic treatments also differed in fertilizer type: a green manure was used for the low-nitrogen treatment, while the highnitrogen treatment contained green and animal manures. Two aphid species showed different responses to fertilizers: the Brassica specialist Brevicoryne brassicae was more abundant on organically fertilized plants, while the generalist Myzus persicae had higher populations on synthetically fertilized plants. The diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (a crucifer specialist) was more abundant on synthetically fertilized plants and preferred to oviposit on these plants. Glucosinolate concentrations were up to three times greater on plants grown in the organic treatments, while foliar nitrogen was maximized on plants under the higher of the synthetic fertilizer treatments. The varying response of herbivore species to these strong differences in plant chemistry demonstrates that hypotheses on defence in organically grown crops have over-simplified the response of phytophagous insects. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {1. The nitrogen limitation hypothesis posits that phytophagous insects benefit from nitrogen enrichment of their host plants through a reduction of the concentration of toxic compounds and an increase of free amino acids and proteins. However, species' response to nitrogen enrichment varies substantially and high nitrogen levels are associated with population decline, suggesting there are major costs to feeding on nitrogen-rich host plants. 2. To test the hypothesis that larval growth performance is maximal at intermediate nitrogen enrichment, nitrogen levels were measured in 18 populations of the host plant of Lycaena helle, a specialist butterfly inhabiting nutrient-poor wet meadows. The nitrogen content of host plants was then modified to mirror average natural nitrogen levels (C), highest field-recorded levels (T1), and levels higher than those observed across our study populations (T2). 3. Caterpillars fed with T1 leaves had a greater maximum body mass than caterpillars of the C group because of their improved food assimilation during the early stages of their development. Caterpillars of C and T2 groups had similar growth patterns but high nitrogen content had detrimental effects, as caterpillars fed with T2 leaves had a slower ingestion rate than C and T1 groups. 4. Quantifying the fitness consequences of these changes in growth performance is necessary to fully understand the implications of nitrogen enrichment for L. helle (rapid growth may result in fitness costs). However, conservation plans for this emblematic glacial relict species should also consider the preservation of its host plant quality to ensure its persistence.},

However, much of this information is contradictory and although it is widely recognised that nutrition can influence disease in crops, limited progress has been made in the manipulation of crop nutrition to enhance disease control. Achieving this aim requires a sound understanding of the effects of fertilisation on nutrient levels and availability in crop tissues, and in turn, how the nutrient status of such tissues influences pathogen infection, colonisation and sporulation. Some of these details are known for a number of crop plants under controlled conditions, but very little of this type of information is available for crops under field conditions. This review focuses on nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, potassium and silicon, examines the availability of these nutrients in plant tissues to support pathogen growth and development, and reviews the effects of the different nutrients on disease development. The review also examines the potential for manipulating crop nutrition to enhance disease control in conventional and organic cropping systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Association of Applied Biologists.},

abstract = {The butterfly Boloria aquilonaris is a specialist of oligotrophic ecosystems. Population viability analysis predicted the species to be stable in Belgium and to collapse in the Netherlands with reduced host plant quality expected to drive species decline in the latter. We tested this hypothesis by rearing B. aquilonaris caterpillars from Belgian and Dutch sites on host plants (the cranberry, Vaccinium oxycoccos). Dutch plant quality was lower than Belgian one conferring lower caterpillar growth rate and survival. Reintroduction and/or supplementation may be necessary to ensure the viability of the species in the Netherlands, but some traits may have been selected solely in Dutch caterpillars to cope with gradual changes in host plant quality. To test this hypothesis, the performance of Belgian and Dutch caterpillars fed with plants from both countries were compared. Dutch caterpillars performed well on both plant qualities, whereas Belgian caterpillars could not switch to lower quality plants. This can be considered as an environmentally induced plastic response of caterpillars and/or a local adaptation to plant quality, which precludes the use of Belgian individuals as a unique solution for strengthening Dutch populations. More generally, these results stress that the relevance of local adaptation in selecting source populations for relocation may be as important as restoring habitat quality. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {The decline of cooking banana production in parts of East Africa has been associated with a loss of soil fertility and increased pest pressure. Previous work indicated that the use of mineral fertilizers at recommended rates is not financially viable on plantations where pest pressure is high. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of half the recommended rates of mineral fertilizers and organic mulch on banana yield, soil and foliar nutrient status, soil water and pest damage in the central region of Uganda. The study was conducted in a four-year old banana plantation infested with weevils. Treatments consisted of mineral fertilizer alone, mulch alone, a combination of mulch with fertilizer, and a control (no mulch from outside the plot, or mineral fertilizer applied). Fruit yield was generally low (mean of 7.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and increases above the control ranged from 1.1 to 2.0 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Banana yield was significantly higher in the sole mulch treatment than in the control. However, there were no significant differences in yield among the treatments that received external inputs. Thus, there was no demonstrable yield advantage of combining mineral fertilizer with mulch. At the end of the trial, soil K concentrations in the two treatments that were mulched, were almost twice those of the control, but this difference was not statistically significant. Concentrations of Ca and Mg did not differ with treatment. Soil available P significantly increased when mineral fertilizer and organic mulch were combined. Treatments that received organic mulch were lower in foliar concentrations of N and Mg, and higher in K. Soil water content was greater in the surface soil layer in the treatments that received mulch, presumably due to less surface run-off and evaporation, since there was no change in surface soil porosity. The effect of organic and inorganic amendments had no impact on weevil damage, which remained above 5{\%} at the end of the trial. We conclude that where weevil damage is over 5{\%} of the cross section near the collar, banana production may not be economically increased through use of either mineral fertilizer and/or organic mulch.},

Optimized management of chemical fertilizers and pesticides will be essential for achieving sustainability of intensive farming and requires both empirical data from field trials and advanced fundamental understanding of the molecular processes controlling plant growth. Genes involved in plant responses to nutrient deficiency and pathogen/herbivore attack have been identified, but we are lacking information about the cross-talk between signalling pathways when plants are exposed to a combination of abiotic and biotic stress factors. The focus of this review is on the relationship between the potassium status of plants and their susceptibility to pathogens and herbivorous insects. We combine field evidence on potassiumG{\c{C}}{\^{o}}disease interaction with existing knowledge on metabolic and physiological factors that could explain such interaction, and present new data on metabolite profiles and hormonal pathways from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The latter provides evidence that facilitated entry and development of pathogens or insects in(to) potassium-deficient plants as a result of physical and metabolic changes is counteracted by an increased defence. A genetic approach should now be applied to establish a causal relationship between disease susceptibility on the one hand and individual enzymatic and signal components on the other. Once identified, these can be used to design agricultural strategies that support the nutritional status of the crops while exploiting their inherent potential for defence},

abstract = {Major constraints to banana (Musa spp., genome group AAA) production, a dietary staple for over 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, are pest infestations, poor nutrition and inadequate water. Although mulch can improve soil water and nutrient status, many farmers believe it also promotes the proliferation of banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus), one of the most serious banana pests. In this study, we evaluated the effects of mulch location (mulch to base of banana pseudostem; mulch recessed 1 m from the pseudostem) on banana weevil, soil and plant nutrient status, soil water, and banana growth and development. After 3 years, the fully mulched plots had significantly more soil Ca and Mg than plots that did not receive mulch. Banana foliar K concentration was significantly higher in both mulch treatments (full and recessed) than in the control (no mulch) plots. The mulched plots had greater recharge after rainfall events and higher soil water contents during diy periods due to increased infiltration in the mulched plots. However, the mulched plots also exhibited significantly higher banana weevil densities and greater plant damage than the control plots. There was no difference in weevil damage with mulch location, although weevil density was higher in the fully mulched plots throughout most of the trial. Despite greater weevil damage, the treatments that were mulched yielded significantly heavier bunches. Hence the effects of the mulch on soil water infiltration and banana foliar nutrient status outweighed the detrimental effects of banana weevil damage.},

Yield increases above the control ranged from 3.1 to 6.2 kg bunch-1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 11.5 kg bunch-1) and 2.2-11.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (average yield for all treatments 15.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1) at Kawanda, compared with 12.4-16.0 kg bunch-1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 14.7 kg bunch-1) and 7.0-29.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (average yield for all treatments 17.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1) at Ntungamo. The limiting nutrients at both sites were in the order K {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} N. Potassium, N and P foliar nutrient mass fractions were below previously established Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) norms, with the smallest K mass fractions observed in the best yielding plots at Ntungamo. Total nutrient uptakes (K {\textgreater} N {\textgreater} P) were higher at Ntungamo as compared with Kawanda, probably due to better soil moisture availability and root exploration of the soil. Average N, P and K conversion efficiencies for two crop cycles at both sites amounted to 49.2 kg finger DM kg-1 N, 587 kg finger DM kg-1 P and 10.8 kg finger DM kg-1 K. Calibration results of the model QUEFTS using data from Ntungamo were reasonable (R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 648 kg ha-1). Using the measured soil chemical properties and yield data from an experiment at Mbarara in southwest Uganda, the calibrated QUEFTS model predicted yields well (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 562 kg ha-1). We conclude that banana yields can be increased by use of mineral fertilizers, but fertilizer recovery efficiencies need to improve substantially before promoting wide-scale adoption. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Soil properties vary according to the topography. They affect water uptake and root exploration in the soil. Consequently, they may also influence the spread of plant-parasitic nematodes. This study reports on the effect of toposequence-related variations in soil on banana yields, foliar nutrient status, and nematode impact. Twenty banana plots were visited within 6 hills/valleys at each of the three toposequence positions: valley bottom, mid-slope and crest. Important variability in plant growth, nutrition and soil properties was observed within the toposequence. Significantly better plant growth (height and girth) was observed in the valley bottoms, where banana bunch weight was 1.7-3.4 kg higher (although not significant) than at upper toposequence positions. Best plant growth was observed in valley bottoms in contrast to the highest N and K foliar deficiencies in this position. Plants in the valley bottoms had higher foliar Ca and Mg, and K compared to those in the crest. Plants in the mid-slope had greater percentage of dead roots (19.1{\%}), compared to the plants in the valley bottoms (12.3{\%}) and the crest (14.2{\%}). Soils in the valley bottoms were deeper, sandier, with lower organic matter, lower N, and K compared to the soils at higher toposequence. Nematodes likely play a key role in banana root damage, however, their effect appear to be in relation to various soil factors at each position. The abundance of Pratylenchus goodeyi had generally limited impact on banana yields in fields having less than 5{\%} slope (crest and valley bottom) where soil conditions were more optimal for root growth. However, in the presence of increased run-off on steeper middle slopes, root death was increased even under moderate pressure from P. goodeyi.},

Our data suggested that the application of either organic or synthetic fertilizers could increase pest populations on tomatoes. However, there were lower populations of aphids on tomatoes grown with the organic fertilizer than on those grown with the synthetic fertilizers in the second year of the experiment, indicating that organic fertilizers may have the potential to reduce pest attacks in the long term. Anthocorid populations were larger on tomato plants with high aphid populations in the synthetic than in the organic fertilizers-treated plots.},

abstract = {Drought stress, potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) deficiencies are major constraints to rain-fed East African highland banana (EAHB) production in Uganda. It was hypothesised that the reduction in fresh bunch mass and increase in dry matter (DM) allocation to corms with drought stress, K and N deficiency is additive. Individual plant measurements at harvest from two field trials in central and south western Uganda were analyzed to evaluate effects of cumulative rainfall (CRF) received 365 days from sucker emergence, mineral K and N inputs on EAHB bunch yields. Dry matter content in aerial shoot (leaves and pseudostems) relative to that in the subterranean corm was also analyzed to evaluate DM allocation plasticity due to drought stress, K and N deficiency. This was verified with allometric analysis using pre-harvest stage plants from farms of known K and N nutritional status and plants from a screen house drought stress pot trial in Uganda. Dry matter production and yields were mainly driven by K interacting with CRF. Within 12 months, K input (250-600kgKha-1yr-1) increased bunch yield from 8 to 15Mgha-1yr-1 irrespective of whether dry (CRF{\textless}1100mm) or wet (CRF≥1100mm) conditions prevailed, possibly due to K-mediated osmotic adjustment under dry conditions. Without K input, wet conditions increased bunch yield from 6 to 8Mgha-1yr-1 while dry conditions decreased it from 6 to 4Mgha-1yr-1 within 12 months. Total DM and its distribution between the biomass structures followed similar trends. Nitrogen input (150-400kgNha-1yr-1) neither affected bunch yield nor DM allocation at harvest stage. At pre-harvest stage, reduction in DM allocation to the corm per unit increase in total DM was 14-22{\%} significantly lower with N and/or K deficiency compared with that under sufficient K and N. Drought stress per se had no effect on DM allocation but enhanced DM allocation shifts due to K deficiency. Drought-stressed EAHB thus increase DM allocation to subterranean structures only if K-deficient, unlike responses reported for other plant species. Potassium nutrition is perhaps a more viable entry point for mitigation of drought stress in EAHB cropping systems than irrigation but this requires further agronomic and economic evaluation. It may be important to account for carbon allocated to osmotic adjustment for realistic simulation of water- and K-limited growth in EAHB. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In banana on-farm studies in the East African Highlands, quantification of production has been difficult because plants are at different stages of development at any given time. Production is continuous and quantification would therefore require permanent presence of an observer. Hence, most on-farm surveys have resorted to estimations from farmers or 'experts' through recall or visual qualitative observations. These methods are highly inaccurate. This study aims to develop and validate allometric relationships for quantitative estimation of bunch weights, based on rapid, inexpensive and non-destructive methods of data collection that take into consideration genotypic, spatial and developmental variability. The study was conducted in 179 farmer fields in central, south, southwest, and east Uganda. Bunch weights were estimated through linear regression with log-transformed girth of pseudostem at base and 1m, number of hands, and number of fingers in the lower row of the second lowest hand. The number of hands and fingers relate to the potential sink size (i.e. bunch), and the girth at base and 1m were used as a proxy for pseudostem volume, which relates to the potential of the plant to fill the sink. Bunch weight was significantly (P ??? 0.001) and positively (R2 = 0.73) related to log-transformed pseudostem volume, and number of hands and fingers. When data were partitioned and regressed, regression coefficients did not differ significantly for cultivars (i.e. Enyeru, Kibuzi, Nakabululu and Nakitembe), developmental stages (flowering, early fruiting, late fruiting and full maturity), regions (central, south, southwest and east Uganda), foliar and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. Data partitioning improved the accuracy of prediction significantly for different cultivars, regions, and foliar Ca, but not for bunch developmental stages, foliar N, P, K and Mg and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. However, the residuals of all the regressions of partitioned data correlated highly (R2 between 0.92 and 1.00) to those of the regression based on pooled data. On validation of the regression based on pooled data, the bias (-9.97{\%}) and modeling efficiency statistic (0.64), suggested that predictions were not always accurate. Still, the total predicted bunch weights were higher than the observed bunch weight by only 2{\%}. This study therefore concludes that the regression derived using pooled data is suitable for on-farm prediction of bunch weight, for the East African Highland cooking banana, regardless of genotypic, developmental and spatial variations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), is a nocturnal insect that is not readily observed in banana fields. Knowledge on its distribution is essential for the design of management strategies that target the adult stage. Marked weevils were released into seven-year-old banana plots. Ten days later the plots were systematically sampled for adult weevils by first removing the banana leaf mulch and residues, searching subsections of the soil to depths of 3 and 25 cm and, finally, removal and dissection of the banana mats. Of the marked weevils, 62, 56 and 82{\%} respectively, were recovered in three trials. Most weevils were found in close association with either the banana mat (46–66{\%}) or with cut residues lying on the ground between the mats (24–31{\%}). Lesser numbers were found in the leaf mulch and in the top 3 cm of soil away from the mat. The distribution of weevils is likely to be influenced by crop management practices and the availability of residues and by the presence of mulch. Implications for banana weevil IPM are discussed.},

Farmers practiced sanitation levels that were broadly defined as low, moderate and high, with most farmers at the lower end. During the study, some farmers were asked to maintain their original level of management, while others were asked to increase sanitation levels. However, farmers did not strictly adhere to prescribed treatments so that an incomplete block design was used in the analysis of data. Increase in sanitation level from low to high significantly reduced C. sordidus adult populations, lowered corm damage, increased plant maturation rates and increased yields. The data suggest that improved sanitation management can contribute to C. sordidus control and improved banana productivity. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A study was conducted in Uganda to determine the effect of mulching on banana (Musa spp. L.) weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), movement relative to pheromone-baited traps. Three treatments were used to create different mulching levels: banana without mulch (control), banana with thin mulch ({\textless} 6 cm thick), and banana with thick mulch (15 cm thick). Pheromone traps were placed in the plots and weevil trap catches were monitored. Weevil catches in pheromone traps from both mulched and unmulched plots were generally similar. The mulching level had no effect on the ratio of males to females recaptured. The numbers of weevils captured in pheromone traps were lower than in the wet season and was not influenced by mulch levels. Mulching levels had a limited influence on the numbers of weevils recaptured from different directions. The results generally indicate that mulching has no effect on weevil catches in phero- mone traps.},

abstract = {Yield decline in plantain cultivation is a common occurrence after few production cycles due to low levels of soil organic matter and increased susceptibility to biotic stress. The use of improved varieties is a cheap and eco-friendly option to combat plant diseases; however, sustaining the yield of a new cultivar in the farmers' fields requires good soil fertility management which could be achieved through judicious use of poultry manure. The effects of three rates of decomposed poultry manure (0, 10 and 20 t.ha-1) on growth, black Sigatoka disease response and yield attributes of 'PITA 24' (a plantain hybrid) and its maternal grandparent 'Mbi-Egome' (a landrace plantain) were evaluated at Onne (Nigeria), at the high rainfall station of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. The experiment was laid-out as a split plot in a randomized complete block design. Except for leaf area and chlorophyll content, results showed that both clones had similar growth variables. Notwithstanding the susceptibility of the hybrid genotype to the air-borne fungal leaf spot sigatoka disease, data on the components of yield showed that 'PITA 24' produced significantly (P0.05) higher values for number of hands and fingers per bunch, bunch yield and total biological yield, however, both genotypes had similar biomass distribution pattern. Manured plants had a significant (P0.05) yield improvement over the control plants; but, there was a yield decline at 20 t.ha-1 application rate. Increasing manure rates reduced days to harvest by over 30 days; similarly, plant stature, suckering, leaf chlorophyll content, index of non-spotted leaves, crop cycling and total biomass increased with increasing manure rate. It was apparent from our study that 10 t.ha-1 of poultry manure per annum supported the best yield attributes.},

abstract = {Mulches have been shown to encourage banana weevils, presumably through enhanced water conservation. Some farmers report that leaving the soil at base of the banana mat free of mulch reduces banana weevil damage. Trials were conducted at the Kawanda Agriculture Research Institute and on a farm in Ntungamo District, Uganda to investigate the effect of mulch recessed from the mat versus mulches applied to the base of the banana mat on banana weevil populations, banana weevil damage, plant growth and fruit production. In both trials, banana weevil populations were higher in mulched than in unmulched systems, while damage was greater in mulched systems in Kawanda, but not in Ntungamo. Damage was similar between recessed and full mulched systems in Kawanda, while, contrary to expectation, damage was lower in full than in recessed mulches in Ntungamo. In both sites plants were larger in mulched than in unmulched systems with yield advantages of 18-27{\%}. We conclude that mulching is beneficial for banana production, but that there are no banana weevil management advantages to mulching away from the base of the banana mat. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Banana is the primary food crop in Uganda, but yields are low due to a complex of abiotic and biotic constraints. However, quantitative information on the importance, interactions, and geographic distribution of yields and constraints is scanty. We monitored yields, biotic and abiotic constraints in 159 plots in Central, South and Southwest Uganda in 2006-2007. About half the plots were on-farm demonstrations that received fertilizer (average 71N, 8P, 32 K kg ha-1 year-1) through a development project, the rest were ordinary farmer fields (i.e. controls). Fresh banana yields in controls were significantly (P ??? 0.05) higher in Southwest (20 t ha-1 year-1) compared with Central (12 t ha-1 year-1) and South (10 t ha-1 year-1). Demonstrations yielded 3-10 t ha-1 year-1 more than controls. Yield losses were calculated using the boundary line approach. In Central, yield losses, expressed as percentage of attainable yield, were mainly attributed to pests (nematodes 10{\%} loss, weevils - 6{\%}) and suboptimal crop management (mulch 25{\%}). In South, poor soil quality (pH - 21{\%}, SOM - 13{\%}, N-total - 13{\%}, and Clay - 11{\%}) and suboptimal crop management (weeds - 20{\%}) were the main constraints. In Southwest, suboptimal crop management (mulch 16{\%}), poor soil quality (K/(Ca + Mg) - 11{\%}) and low rainfall (5{\%}) were the primary constraints. The study revealed that biotic stresses (i.e. pests, weeds) are particularly important in Central, whereas abiotic stresses (i.e. nutrient deficiencies, drought) dominate in South and Southwest. This study concludes that (i) technologies currently available allow farmers to double yields and (ii) past research efforts have mistakenly neglected abiotic constraints. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although drought stress has been identified among the production constraints of East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EA genome), no quantitative data were available to support this assumption. This study uses data from three on-station fertilizer trials (5-6 cycles) in Central and Southwest Uganda to quantify the effect of drought stress on banana production and explore possible interactions with nutrient availability. Production data were collected at individual plant basis from 1996 to 2002 in one trial and from 2004 to 2009 in two trials. Cumulative rainfall in the 12 months before harvest (CRF12) was computed per plant from daily rainfall measurements. Average bunch weight ranged from 8.0 to 21.9 kg between trials and cycles and was 8-28{\%} less in dry (CRF12{\textless}=905 mm) than in normal (905{\textless}CRF12{\textless}=1365 mm) rainfall periods. Linear relations were observed between CRF12 and maximum bunch weight over the whole range of observed CRF12 (500-1750 mm), whereby every 100 mm decline in rainfall caused maximum bunch weight losses of 1.5-3.1 kg or 8-10{\%}. Optimum annual rainfall for East African highland bananas may thus be well above 1200-1300 mm yr-1 as suggested earlier. Relative drought-induced yield losses were independent of soil fertility. Absolute losses on fertile/fertilized soils were similar to those recorded in well fertilized irrigation studies in Latin America. Our study suggests that drought-induced yield losses in areas of the East African highlands with annual rainfall {\textless}1100 mm are perhaps as high as 20-65{\%} compared to the wetter areas in this region. To improve productivity of smallholder banana farmers in Africa, more attention should be given to research geared towards improved water/drought stress management.},

abstract = {Yield loss in highland banana caused by the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus, was studied in field trials in Uganda. Weevils were released at the base of banana mats 9 months after planting. Weevil populations, corm damage, plant growth and yield were assessed over four crop cycles. The effect of damage was greater on bunch weight than on plant growth and rate of development. Yield loss increased with crop cycle and ranged from 5{\%} in the first cycle to 44{\%} in the fourth cycle. The cumulative effect of heavy damage sustained over several crop cycles resulted in greater reduction in bunch weight than that inflicted by similar levels of damage in a single cycle. The data suggest that C. sordidus damage is a leading cause of highland banana decline and disappearance in central Uganda.},

abstract = {Banana (Musa AAA) and plantain (Musa AAB) are important dietary staples for over 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) and nematodes (Radopholus similis, Helicotylenchus multicinctus) are often the largest constraints to production. Leguminous crops in the genera Canavalia, Mucuna and Tephrosia have been reported as having repellent or insecticidal properties. We assessed: weevil and nematode populations and damage; banana growth and development; soil and foliar nutrient concentrations; and soil moisture status in banana intercropped with three legumes (Canavalia ensiformis, Mucuna pruriens and Tephrosia vogelii). The research took place at Kawanda, Uganda, on a field site infested with weevils and nematodes. The legume intercrops did not affect weevil populations or damage. The legumes also provided no benefit in terms of nematode control; in fact, banana root necrosis was higher in the T. vogelii intercrop than in the banana monoculture. Banana fruit yield was not adversely affected by the legume intercrops. The low yield noted across treatments was attributed to the high level of damage by the weevils and the nematodes. Significantly more NO3-N accumulated from 0- to 0.3-m depth in the M. pruriens intercrop than in the other treatments. There was no treatment difference in soil moisture. In summary, there was no significant advantage in banana production associated with the legume intercrops. However, the lack of a significant difference in banana fruit production between the monoculture and the intercrops suggests that land use efficiency may be increased by incorporating food and or/fodder legumes into the banana cropping system.},

Low agricultural productivity, exploding populations, and escalating urbanization have led to declining per capita food availability. In order to reverse this trend, crop production systems must intensify, which brings with it an elevated threat from pests and diseases, including plant-parasitic nematodes. A holistic systems approach to pest management recognizes disciplinary integration. However, a critical under-representation of nematol-ogy expertise is a pivotal shortcoming, especially given the magnitude of the threat nematodes pose under more intensified systems. With more volatile climates, efficient use of water by healthy root systems is especially crucial. Within SSA, smallholder farming systems dominate the agricultural},

abstract = {Banana production landscapes in the African Great Lakes Region (AGLR) have been under immense pressure from Xanthomonas wilt (XW) disease over the past two decades. XW, first reported on banana in central Uganda and eastern DR Congo in 2001, has since spread to the entire AGLR. XW is currently spreading westwards from hot spots in eastern DR Congo highlands, putting the plantain (Musa AAB genome) belt of central and west Africa at risk. In-depth understanding of the key variables responsible for disease spread, current hotspots, and vulnerable landscapes is crucial for disease early warning and management. We mapped aggregated disease distribution and hotspots in the AGLR and identified vulnerable landscapes across African banana production zones. Available data on disease prevalence collected over 11 years was regressed against environmental and expert developed covariates to develop the AGLR XW hotspots map. For the Africa-wide risk map, precipitation, distance to hotspots, degree of trade in fresh banana products, production zone interconnectedness and banana genotype composition were used as covariates. In the AGLR, XW was mainly correlated to precipitation and disease/banana management. Altitude and temperature had unexpectedly low effects, possibly due to an overriding impact of tool-mediated spread which is part of the management covariate. In the AGLR, the eastern part of DR Congo was a large hotspot with highest vulnerability. Apart from endemic zones in the AGLR and Ethiopia, northern Mozambique was perceived as a moderate risk zone mainly due to the predominance of ‘Bluggoe' (Musa ABB type) which is highly susceptible to insect-vectored transmission. Presence of XW hotspots (e.g. eastern DR Congo) and vulnerable areas with low (e.g. north-western Tanzania) or no disease (e.g. Congo basin, western DR Congo and northern Mozambique) pressure suggest key areas where proactive measures e.g. quarantines and information sharing on XW diagnosis, epidemiology, and control could be beneficial.},

abstract = {Background The cultivation of bananas and other plants is limited by environmental stresses caused by climate change. In order to recognize physiological, biochemical and molecular components indicated to confer tolerance to water stress in Musa spp. we present the first systematic review on the topic. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted using four databases for academic research (Google Academic, Springer, CAPES Journal Portal and PubMed Central). In order to avoid publication bias, a previously established protocol and inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. Results The drought tolerance response is genotype-dependent, therefore the most studied varieties are constituted by the “B” genome. Tolerant plants are capable of super-expressing genes related to reisistance and defense response, maintaining the osmotic equilibrium and elimination of free radicals. Furthermore, they have higher amounts of water content, chlorophyll levels, stomatic conductance and dry root matter, when compared to susceptible plants. Conclusions In recent years, few integrated studies on the effects of water stress on bananas have been carried out and none related to flood stress. Therefore, we highlight the need for new studies on the mechanisms of differentially expressed proteins in response to stress regulation, post-translational mechanisms and epigenetic inheritance in bananas.},

abstract = {Objective: Banana weevil has been reported as a serious pest on banana, an important staple and food crop in the east African region. This study was conducted to establish the impact of weevil infestation on Musa spp. growth traits during the first crop cycle. Methodology and results: Experiments were carried out using eight Musa spp. comprising of the East African highland bananas (Musa spp, AAA-EAHB group); Mpologoma, Lwadungu, Nakitembe, Mbwazirume and Kibuzi; the dessert banana Sukali Ndiizi (AAB); the plantain Gonja (AAB) and the beer banana Kayinja (ABB). All genotypes were assessed at bunch maturity. Weevil build-up and subsequent damage to the banana corms during the first crop cycle was low, presenting an average cross-sectional corm damage of 1.2{\%}. Consequently, hardly any significant negative effects on yield and growth traits were observed. Conclusion and application of findings: The results suggest that several ratoon cycles may be required in order to achieve a high weevil population density build-up to cause substantial reduction in yield and plant growth. The results also show that genotypes with a 'B' genome such as Sukali Ndiizi and Kayinja are more tolerant to banana weevils than genotypes with only 'A' genomes.},

abstract = {Low yields of East African highland bananas (Musa spp. AAA-EA) are often attributed to poor and declining soil fertility, which outweighs other biophysical factors and management practices. We investigated the influence of planting density on nutrient mass fractions and nutrient imbalance indices in bananas under small-scale, low-input systems using the compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND) approach. Boundary line functions were developed to identify yield limiting factors and quantify their contribution to the yield gap. Soil, plant, yield and water data were collected in plant density experiments conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (i.e. Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall but low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility). Effects of site×cultivar and site×density on bunch yield were significant (p{\textless}0.05). Annual yields (tha-1yr-1) ranged from 6.1 to 9.2 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 at Ruhengeri. Similar trends were registered for the above ground dry matter yield. CND indices showed that K, Mg and P were the most deficient elements in areas with low inherent soil fertility (Kibungo and Rubona). The yield gap analysis also confirmed that K was the most limiting factor, contributing to a predicted yield gap of 55.3{\%} at Kibungo while P and Mg collectively contributed to a 35{\%} yield gap at Rubona. An increase in plant density resulted in an increase in average yield gap from 45.6 to 70.2{\%} at Kibungo, whilst the average yield gap decreased significantly with increases in plant density from 47.5 to 30.2{\%} at Rubona and 76.6 to 53.7{\%} at Ruhengeri. The study confirmed that soil fertility is a more limiting factor than water, but both CND norms and boundary line analysis showed that predicted yield gaps seem to be higher for plant density than soil fertility. Therefore, plant density management is an entry point to optimize yield of East African highland bananas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, a categorical random-effects meta-analysis and a vote count meta-analysis are employed to examine the effects of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and NPK fertiliser on insect population dynamics. In agreement with the general consensus, insects were found to respond positively, overall, to fertilisers. Sucking insects showed a much stronger response to fertilisers than chewing insects. The environment in which a study is conducted can have a marked effect on insect responses to fertiliser, with natural environments showing the potential for buffering effects of nitrogen fertilisers in particular. As well as highlighting the potential shortfall in the amount of research investigating particularly the effects of potassium and phosphorus, this study provides an invaluable flag post in the ongoing research investigating fertiliser effects on ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Association of Applied Biologists.},

abstract = {Highland bananas are an important staple food in East Africa, but there is little information on their physiology and growth patterns. This makes it difficult to identify opportunities for yield improvement. We studied allometric relationships by evaluating different phenological stages of highland banana growth for use in growth assessment, understanding banana crop physiology and yield prediction. Pared corms of uniform size (cv. Kisansa) were planted in a pest-free field in Kawanda (central Uganda), supplied with fertilizers and irrigated during dry periods. In addition, tissue-cultured plants (cv. Kisansa) were planted in an adjacent field and in Ntungamo (southwest Uganda), with various nutrient addition treatments (of N, P, K, Mg, S, Zn, B and Mo). Plant height, girth at base, number of functional leaves and phenological stages were monitored monthly. Destructive sampling allowed derivation of allometric relationships to describe leaf area and biomass distribution in plants throughout the growth cycle. Individual leaf area was estimated as LA (m2)=length (m) x maximum lamina width (m) x 0.68. Total plant leaf area (TLA) was estimated as the product of the measured middle leaf area (MLA) and the number of functional leaves. MLA was estimated as MLA (m2)=-0.404+0.381 height (m)+0.411 girth (m). A light extinction coefficient (k=0.7) was estimated from photosynthetically active radiation measurements in a 1.0 m grid over the entire day. The dominant dry matter (DM) sinks changed from leaves at 1118 degrees C days (47{\%} of DM) and 1518 degrees C days (46{\%} of DM), to the stem at 2125 degrees C days (43{\%} of DM) and 3383 degrees C days (58{\%} of DM), and finally to the bunch at harvest (4326 degrees C days) with 53{\%} of DM. The allometric relationship between above-ground biomass (AGB in kg DM) and girth (cm) during the vegetative phase followed a power function, AGB=0.0001 (girth)2.35 (R2=0.99), but followed exponential functions at flowering, AGB=0.325 e0.036(girth) (R2=0.79) and at harvest, AGB=0.069 e0.068(girth) (R2=0.96). Girth at flowering was a good parameter for predicting yields with R2=0.7 (cv. Mbwazirume) and R2=0.57 (cv. Kisansa) obtained between actual and predicted bunch weights. This article shows that allometric relationship can be derived and used to assess biomass production and for developing banana growth models, which can help breeders and agronomists to further exploit the crop's potential.},
