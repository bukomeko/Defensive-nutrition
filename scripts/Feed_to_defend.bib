abstract = {The cultivation of plantain and cooking banana in humid areas of Uganda continues to grow in importance as rural population densities increase and as demand from urban areas intensifies. Difficulties accompany this importance, particularly soil depletion and intensification of pests and diseases of banana. We interviewed 510 farm families practising banana-based cultivation in six districts along the Lake Victoria Basin of southern-central Uganda to determine which resource management strategies are undertaken to mitigate limitations to banana cultivation and the importance of livestock and intercropping within those systems. Of the farmers interviewed, 97{\%} reapply banana stalks and leaves to the banana mats on pruning and upon harvest, a practice that may contribute to banana weevil, stem nematode and sigatoka fungal attacks. Banana stalks were also applied as mulches to cash (4{\%}) and field crops (2{\%}) and used as livestock feed (10{\%}). Farmers applied a wide range of additional resources to bananas including field crop residues (81{\%}), burned residues (3{\%}), on-farm manures (31{\%}), compost (16{\%}), external organic (17{\%}) and chemical (4{\%}) inputs. Of the organic inputs applied to bananas, bean trash (72{\%}), maize stover (68{\%}), cattle manure (45{\%}) and composts (18{\%}) were most frequently applied. It was necessary to consider at least five different organic inputs to account for more than 90{\%} of farmer practices. Overall, intercropping was practised by 69{\%} of the farmers. The six most encountered intercrops were, in decreasing order, beans, maize, cassava, Ficus nataliensis and fruit trees. When organic matter management was separated into five general categories depending on the reliance upon bananas, other crops, manures and composts as organic additions to soils, significant differences in reported average bunch weights were obtained. The farmers applying banana stalks, field crop residues and cattle manures reported the largest bunch weights (20.3 kg per bunch). Farmers relying upon banana stalks alone, banana stalks with field crop residues and either small livestock manure or domestic compost reported the lowest yields (13.1, 14.3 and 12.9 kg per bunch, respectively). We conclude that farmers are developing strategies to resist fertility depletion, in part through better recycling of on-farm resources and intercropping but greater reliance upon external inputs may be required to ameliorate declining banana yields.},

abstract = {The Plant Vigor Hypothesis (PVH) predicts an oviposition preference of females and higher offspring performance for insect herbivores on longer and fast-growing plant modules. We tested the PVH predictions by investigating the effects of leaf size of Miconia prasina (Sw.) DC. (Melastomataceae) on the oviposition preference and on the offspring survival of the gall-inducing weevil Prospoliata bicolorata (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Additionally, we analysed the effects of top-down mortality force on this system. Approximately 83{\%} of the developed galls resulted in adults of P. bicolorata, whereas 17{\%} of the galls successfully induced were killed by natural enemies (top-down effect). Leaves of intermediate size were more abundant while smaller and longer leaves were rare. Nevertheless, the percentage of P. bicolorata galls was higher on the smallest leaves of M. prasina, refuting the preference prediction of the PVH. Our results also refuted the performance prediction: the ratio of survival per leaf was negatively related to the leaf length. Thus, we found a link between female preference and larval performance of P. bicolorata on small-sized leaves of M. prasina. The next goal is to understand the mechanisms involved in the selection of gall-inducing weevil on short leaves of its host plant.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of a thorough understanding of the effect of synthetic fertiliser on insect population dynamics, existing literature is conflicting and an area of intense debate. Here, a categorical random-effects meta-analysis and a vote count meta-analysis are employed to examine the effects of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and NPK fertiliser on insect population dynamics. In agreement with the general consensus, insects were found to respond positively, overall, to fertilisers. Sucking insects showed a much stronger response to fertilisers than chewing insects. The environment in which a study is conducted can have a marked effect on insect responses to fertiliser, with natural environments showing the potential for buffering effects of nitrogen fertilisers in particular. As well as highlighting the potential shortfall in the amount of research investigating particularly the effects of potassium and phosphorus, this study provides an invaluable flag post in the ongoing research investigating fertiliser effects on ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Association of Applied Biologists.},

Our data suggested that the application of either organic or synthetic fertilizers could increase pest populations on tomatoes. However, there were lower populations of aphids on tomatoes grown with the organic fertilizer than on those grown with the synthetic fertilizers in the second year of the experiment, indicating that organic fertilizers may have the potential to reduce pest attacks in the long term. Anthocorid populations were larger on tomato plants with high aphid populations in the synthetic than in the organic fertilizers-treated plots.},

abstract = {East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EA group) are a primary food and cash crop for smallholders in Rwanda and much of the East African highlands. Their production generally declines over time due to poor farm management and declining soil fertility. Farmers believe that among the bunch mass maintaining factors, plant density management offers some prospect. They often decrease banana mat (i.e. a single mother plant with interconnected suckers) density in an effort to increase bunch size, but the effectiveness and profitability of this practice has not been studied. In addition, not much research has been executed on the influence of climatic and edaphic factors on variations in on-farm plant density. An on-farm survey was conducted in contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Ruhengeri, Rusizi, Karongi, Butare, Ruhango, Kibungo and Bugesera) to determine existing densities and their relationship to bunch mass. A plant density assessment method was used that measures the average distance of five mats to their respective nearest four mats to calculate average mat spacing. Plant density positively correlated with surplus/deficit water supply (i.e. difference between rainfall and water demand by bananas) (r 2=0.62), with highest plant densities ({\textgreater}1500matsha -1) found in high rainfall areas ({\textgreater}1200mmyr -1) with water surplus (218-508mmyr -1) and lowest plant densities (1000-1400matsha -1) found in lower rainfall areas (1000-1200mmyr -1) with water deficit (from -223 to -119mmyr -1). Heaviest bunches (18.1-20.8kgfreshmassplant -1) were found at lowest plant densities and medium sized bunches (14.7-15.5kg) at highest plant densities. Lower soil and banana leaf nutrient contents (especially N, K, Ca and Mg) were observed on weathered soils (Acrisols) and were associated with smaller bunch mass in comparison to fertile soils (Andosols, Nitisols). Farmers tended to reduce mat densities (i) if they wanted to intercrop bearing in mind site characteristics, and (ii) to increase bunch mass to adapt to market preferences. The plant densities generally recommended by extension bodies (3m×3m or 2m×3m; i.e. 1111 and 1666matsha -1, respectively) are seldom practiced by farmers, nor do they seem to be very appropriate, as higher densities seem productive in areas with high rainfall and relatively good soil fertility. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Drought stress, potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) deficiencies are major constraints to rain-fed East African highland banana (EAHB) production in Uganda. It was hypothesised that the reduction in fresh bunch mass and increase in dry matter (DM) allocation to corms with drought stress, K and N deficiency is additive. Individual plant measurements at harvest from two field trials in central and south western Uganda were analyzed to evaluate effects of cumulative rainfall (CRF) received 365 days from sucker emergence, mineral K and N inputs on EAHB bunch yields. Dry matter content in aerial shoot (leaves and pseudostems) relative to that in the subterranean corm was also analyzed to evaluate DM allocation plasticity due to drought stress, K and N deficiency. This was verified with allometric analysis using pre-harvest stage plants from farms of known K and N nutritional status and plants from a screen house drought stress pot trial in Uganda. Dry matter production and yields were mainly driven by K interacting with CRF. Within 12 months, K input (250-600kgKha-1yr-1) increased bunch yield from 8 to 15Mgha-1yr-1 irrespective of whether dry (CRF{\textless}1100mm) or wet (CRF≥1100mm) conditions prevailed, possibly due to K-mediated osmotic adjustment under dry conditions. Without K input, wet conditions increased bunch yield from 6 to 8Mgha-1yr-1 while dry conditions decreased it from 6 to 4Mgha-1yr-1 within 12 months. Total DM and its distribution between the biomass structures followed similar trends. Nitrogen input (150-400kgNha-1yr-1) neither affected bunch yield nor DM allocation at harvest stage. At pre-harvest stage, reduction in DM allocation to the corm per unit increase in total DM was 14-22{\%} significantly lower with N and/or K deficiency compared with that under sufficient K and N. Drought stress per se had no effect on DM allocation but enhanced DM allocation shifts due to K deficiency. Drought-stressed EAHB thus increase DM allocation to subterranean structures only if K-deficient, unlike responses reported for other plant species. Potassium nutrition is perhaps a more viable entry point for mitigation of drought stress in EAHB cropping systems than irrigation but this requires further agronomic and economic evaluation. It may be important to account for carbon allocated to osmotic adjustment for realistic simulation of water- and K-limited growth in EAHB. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This book is a compilation of case studies from different countries and covers contemporary with future prospective for sustainable development of agriculture. The book highlights the real-world as well as future generation situations facing the challenges for the twenty first century will be production of sufficient food and highlights the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities, to meet the needs of fast growing population it is imperative to increase agricultural productivity in an environmentally sustainable manner. Due to imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals has a considerable negative impact on economy and environmental sustainability of nation, for the sustainable alternative means to solve these problems, the efficient utilization of biological agents have been extensively studied. Naturally existing plant-microbe-environment interactions are utilized in many ways for enhancing plant productivity. A greater understanding of how plants and microbes live together and benefit each other can therefore provide new strategies to improve plant productivity, in most sustainable way. To achieve the objective of sustainable agricultural practices there is a need for understanding both basic and applied aspects of agriculturally important microorganisms. Focus needs to be on transforming agricultural systems from nutrient deficient to nutrient rich soil-plant system. This book is split into two parts, with an aim to provide comprehensive description and highlight a holistic approach. It elucidated various mechanisms of nutrients solubilisation and its importance in enhancement of plant growth, nutrient content, yield of various crops and vegetables as well as soil fertility and health. Unit-1 in this book explains the importance of soil microbes in sustainable crop production. It contains chapters detailing the role and mechanism of action of soil microbes which enhances the productivity via various bio-chemical and molecular channels. In unit-2 the role of microbes in plant protection is elaborated. With the help of case studies of food crops, multiple ways in which soil microbes help in fighting and preventing plant diseases is explained. With the given content and layout book will be an all-inclusive collection of information, which will be useful for students, academicians, researchers working in the field of rhizospheric mechanisms, agricultural microbiology, soil microbiology, biotechnology, agronomy and sustainable agriculture and also for policy makers in the area of food security and sustainable agriculture.},

abstract = {Soil nutrient depletion and Xanthomonas wilt (Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum) are major causes of declining productivity in smallholder banana systems in East and Central Africa. This study examined the interactive effect of fertilizer and inoculum concentration on development of Xanthomonas wilt. Fertilization significantly (p{\textless}0.01) increased the plant height, plant girth and leaf area in banana compared to control without fertilizer. Despite this, between 9 and 21 days post inoculation (dpi) all inoculated plants had exhibited typical disease symptoms (that is, chlorosis, necrosis and wilting of leaves). No significant reduction (p{\textgreater}0.05) in disease incidence, wilt severity index or mortality could be associated with increasing fertilizer amounts. Interestingly, there was a highly significant (p{\textless}0.01) overriding effect of inoculum concentration on the ability of fertilizer to reduce wilt severity index and mortality in banana. Plants inoculated with 106 to 1012 cfu mL-1 developed twice as much disease compared to 104 cfu mL-1 inoculations. Average mortality of 9.2{\%} for 104 cfu mL-1 inoculated plants provides evidence of the potential to cause latent infections. Low bacterial loads are implicated in recent field resurgence of Xanthomonas wilt in banana orchards where disease had been successfully contained.},

@article{Gold2001,
abstract = {The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development. Host plant resistance offers another promising avenue of control. Numerous resistant clones are known, including Yangambi-km 5, Calcutta 4, and Pisang awak. Resistance is most often through antibiosis resulting in egg or larval failure. Banana breeding is a slow and difficult process. Current research is exploring genetic improvement through biotechnology techniques including the introduction of foreign genes. Neem has also shown potential for control of banana weevil. Studies on the use of other botanicals against banana weevil have failed to produce positive results. Chemical control of banana weevil remains a common and effective method for larger scale producers but is beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers. However, the weevil has displayed the ability to develop resistance against a broad range of chemicals. In summary, cultural control remains the most available approach for resource-poor farmers. A combination of several cultural methods is likely to reduce weevil pressure. Among the methods currently under study, microbial control, host plant resistance and neem appear to offer the most promise.},

abstract = {Soil properties vary according to the topography. They affect water uptake and root exploration in the soil. Consequently, they may also influence the spread of plant-parasitic nematodes. This study reports on the effect of toposequence-related variations in soil on banana yields, foliar nutrient status, and nematode impact. Twenty banana plots were visited within 6 hills/valleys at each of the three toposequence positions: valley bottom, mid-slope and crest. Important variability in plant growth, nutrition and soil properties was observed within the toposequence. Significantly better plant growth (height and girth) was observed in the valley bottoms, where banana bunch weight was 1.7-3.4 kg higher (although not significant) than at upper toposequence positions. Best plant growth was observed in valley bottoms in contrast to the highest N and K foliar deficiencies in this position. Plants in the valley bottoms had higher foliar Ca and Mg, and K compared to those in the crest. Plants in the mid-slope had greater percentage of dead roots (19.1{\%}), compared to the plants in the valley bottoms (12.3{\%}) and the crest (14.2{\%}). Soils in the valley bottoms were deeper, sandier, with lower organic matter, lower N, and K compared to the soils at higher toposequence. Nematodes likely play a key role in banana root damage, however, their effect appear to be in relation to various soil factors at each position. The abundance of Pratylenchus goodeyi had generally limited impact on banana yields in fields having less than 5{\%} slope (crest and valley bottom) where soil conditions were more optimal for root growth. However, in the presence of increased run-off on steeper middle slopes, root death was increased even under moderate pressure from P. goodeyi.},

abstract = {A great deal of information is available in the literature on the effects of nutrition on disease development in plants and crops. However, much of this information is contradictory and although it is widely recognised that nutrition can influence disease in crops, limited progress has been made in the manipulation of crop nutrition to enhance disease control. Achieving this aim requires a sound understanding of the effects of fertilisation on nutrient levels and availability in crop tissues, and in turn, how the nutrient status of such tissues influences pathogen infection, colonisation and sporulation. Some of these details are known for a number of crop plants under controlled conditions, but very little of this type of information is available for crops under field conditions. This review focuses on nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, potassium and silicon, examines the availability of these nutrients in plant tissues to support pathogen growth and development, and reviews the effects of the different nutrients on disease development. The review also examines the potential for manipulating crop nutrition to enhance disease control in conventional and organic cropping systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Association of Applied Biologists.},

Plant growth i.e. plant height and the number of nodes declined under insufficient or excessive nitrogen treatment. Compared to optimal N, insufficient N treatment decreased leaf N content and increased the carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) whereas an excess of N had no effect on both leaf N content and leaf C/N ratio. Sub-optimal nitrogen supplies, water treatments and their interactions, significantly reduced the leafminer survival rate and slowed down its development. Together with the findings from three recent companion studies, we assumed that a combination of changes in nutritional value and chemical defense could explain these observed effects. Furthermore, our findings supported both the "Plant vigor hypothesis" and the "Nitrogen limitation hypothesis".},

abstract = {The hypothesis that plants supplied with organic fertilizers are better defended against insect herbivores than those supplied with synthetic fertilizers was tested over two field seasons. Organic and synthetic fertilizer treatments at two nitrogen concentrations were supplied to Brassica plants, and their effects on the abundance of herbivore species and plant chemistry were assessed. The organic treatments also differed in fertilizer type: a green manure was used for the low-nitrogen treatment, while the highnitrogen treatment contained green and animal manures. Two aphid species showed different responses to fertilizers: the Brassica specialist Brevicoryne brassicae was more abundant on organically fertilized plants, while the generalist Myzus persicae had higher populations on synthetically fertilized plants. The diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (a crucifer specialist) was more abundant on synthetically fertilized plants and preferred to oviposit on these plants. Glucosinolate concentrations were up to three times greater on plants grown in the organic treatments, while foliar nitrogen was maximized on plants under the higher of the synthetic fertilizer treatments. The varying response of herbivore species to these strong differences in plant chemistry demonstrates that hypotheses on defence in organically grown crops have over-simplified the response of phytophagous insects. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The butterfly Boloria aquilonaris is a specialist of oligotrophic ecosystems. Population viability analysis predicted the species to be stable in Belgium and to collapse in the Netherlands with reduced host plant quality expected to drive species decline in the latter. We tested this hypothesis by rearing B. aquilonaris caterpillars from Belgian and Dutch sites on host plants (the cranberry, Vaccinium oxycoccos). Dutch plant quality was lower than Belgian one conferring lower caterpillar growth rate and survival. Reintroduction and/or supplementation may be necessary to ensure the viability of the species in the Netherlands, but some traits may have been selected solely in Dutch caterpillars to cope with gradual changes in host plant quality. To test this hypothesis, the performance of Belgian and Dutch caterpillars fed with plants from both countries were compared. Dutch caterpillars performed well on both plant qualities, whereas Belgian caterpillars could not switch to lower quality plants. This can be considered as an environmentally induced plastic response of caterpillars and/or a local adaptation to plant quality, which precludes the use of Belgian individuals as a unique solution for strengthening Dutch populations. More generally, these results stress that the relevance of local adaptation in selecting source populations for relocation may be as important as restoring habitat quality. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition has shifted many ecosystems from nitrogen (N) limitation to phosphorus (P) limitation. Although well documented in plants, no study to date has explored whether N deposition exacerbates P limitation at higher trophic levels, or focused on the effects of induced plant P limitation on trophic interactions. Insect herbivores exhibit strict N : P homeostasis, and should therefore be very sensitive to variations in plant N : P stoichiometry and prone to experiencing deposition-induced P limitation. In the current study, we investigated the effects of N deposition and P availability on a plant-herbivorous insect system. Using common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and two of its specialist herbivores, the monarch caterpillar (Danaus plexippus) and milkweed aphid (Aphis asclepiadis) as our study system, we found that experimental N deposition caused P limitation in milkweed plants, but not in either insect species. However, the mechanisms for the lack of P limitation were different for each insect species. The body tissues of A. asclepiadis always exhibited higher N : P ratios than that of the host plant, suggesting that the N demand of this species exceeds P demand, even under high N deposition levels. For D. plexippus, P addition increased the production of latex, which is an important defense negatively affecting D. plexippus growth rate. As a result, we illustrate that P limitation of herbivores is not an inevitable consequence of anthropogenic N deposition in terrestrial systems. Rather, species-specific demands for nutrients and the defensive responses of plants combine to determine the responses of herbivores to P availability under N deposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Its successful application as a natural tag in stock discrimination studies is based on the ability to distinguish among different groups due to variation in otolith chemical composition.

A short overview of the major achievements in stock identification using otolith chemistry is provided whilst covering the evolution in methodological and analytical approaches over the last decades. Current and future challenges and research gaps are outlined focusing on the need to provide accurate stock structure estimates for management purposes. Overall, there is still large room for improvement regarding how we overcome these challenges and supersede the current gaps in population structure and connectivity studies using otolith chemistry. The most favorable and practical directions for future research are discussed, and include marker integration, new technological and statistical approaches that may contribute in further advancing otolith chemistry and its application in stock delineation. Ultimately, the continued development of holistic approaches combining otolith chemistry with different and potentially complementary techniques is clearly the course of action to promote interconnection between management actions and biological processes, and unambiguously resolve stock structure and scientifically underpin fisheries management.},

Farmers practiced sanitation levels that were broadly defined as low, moderate and high, with most farmers at the lower end. During the study, some farmers were asked to maintain their original level of management, while others were asked to increase sanitation levels. However, farmers did not strictly adhere to prescribed treatments so that an incomplete block design was used in the analysis of data. Increase in sanitation level from low to high significantly reduced C. sordidus adult populations, lowered corm damage, increased plant maturation rates and increased yields. The data suggest that improved sanitation management can contribute to C. sordidus control and improved banana productivity. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1 The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera:$\backslash$nCurculionidae) is a major pest in banana (Musa spp.) growing areas. The$\backslash$nweevil is known to be relatively sedentary and closely associated with$\backslash$nits host plant but little is known about the species' ability to migrate$\backslash$nbetween banana fields and in nonhost habitats.$\backslash$n2 Mark-recapture experiments were conducted to assess the weevils'$\backslash$nmigration potential, possible differences between the sexes, and the$\backslash$nrelative attractiveness of pseudostem and pheromone baits.$\backslash$n3 One thousand two hundred marked weevils were released in the nonhost$\backslash$nhabitat at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from fresh$\backslash$npseudostem, and from pitfall traps baited with 45 mg of sordidin.$\backslash$n4 Two hundred males and 200 females were marked and released at five$\backslash$ndistances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from the pheromone traps.$\backslash$n5 Distance and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on$\backslash$nrecaptured weevils (binary logistic regression). The two baits were$\backslash$nalmost equally attractive to weevils in the range 0-10 m, whereas the$\backslash$npheromone was more attractive in the range 10-100 m.$\backslash$n6 Distance, bait and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect$\backslash$non the time elapsed from release to recapture (regression with life$\backslash$ndata) but the pattern observed was not consistent.$\backslash$n7 There was no significant difference between males and females with$\backslash$nrespect to distance or time elapsed from release to recapture.$\backslash$n8 The results obtained in the present study show that the migration$\backslash$npotential of the banana weevil is greater than previously reported.

Weevils were released at the base of banana mats 9 months after planting. Weevil populations, corm damage, plant growth and yield were assessed over four crop cycles. The effect of damage was greater on bunch weight than on plant growth and rate of development. Yield loss increased with crop cycle and ranged from 5{\%} in the first cycle to 44{\%} in the fourth cycle. The cumulative effect of heavy damage sustained over several crop cycles resulted in greater reduction in bunch weight than that inflicted by similar levels of damage in a single cycle. The data suggest that C. sordidus damage is a leading cause of highland banana decline and disappearance in central Uganda.},

abstract = {Yield decline in plantain cultivation is a common occurrence after few production cycles due to low levels of soil organic matter and increased susceptibility to biotic stress. The use of improved varieties is a cheap and eco-friendly option to combat plant diseases; however, sustaining the yield of a new cultivar in the farmers' fields requires good soil fertility management which could be achieved through judicious use of poultry manure. The effects of three rates of decomposed poultry manure (0, 10 and 20 t.ha-1) on growth, black Sigatoka disease response and yield attributes of 'PITA 24' (a plantain hybrid) and its maternal grandparent 'Mbi-Egome' (a landrace plantain) were evaluated at Onne (Nigeria), at the high rainfall station of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. The experiment was laid-out as a split plot in a randomized complete block design. Except for leaf area and chlorophyll content, results showed that both clones had similar growth variables. Notwithstanding the susceptibility of the hybrid genotype to the air-borne fungal leaf spot sigatoka disease, data on the components of yield showed that 'PITA 24' produced significantly (P0.05) higher values for number of hands and fingers per bunch, bunch yield and total biological yield, however, both genotypes had similar biomass distribution pattern. Manured plants had a significant (P0.05) yield improvement over the control plants; but, there was a yield decline at 20 t.ha-1 application rate. Increasing manure rates reduced days to harvest by over 30 days; similarly, plant stature, suckering, leaf chlorophyll content, index of non-spotted leaves, crop cycling and total biomass increased with increasing manure rate. It was apparent from our study that 10 t.ha-1 of poultry manure per annum supported the best yield attributes.},

abstract = {Mulches have been shown to encourage banana weevils, presumably through enhanced water conservation. Some farmers report that leaving the soil at base of the banana mat free of mulch reduces banana weevil damage. Trials were conducted at the Kawanda Agriculture Research Institute and on a farm in Ntungamo District, Uganda to investigate the effect of mulch recessed from the mat versus mulches applied to the base of the banana mat on banana weevil populations, banana weevil damage, plant growth and fruit production. In both trials, banana weevil populations were higher in mulched than in unmulched systems, while damage was greater in mulched systems in Kawanda, but not in Ntungamo. Damage was similar between recessed and full mulched systems in Kawanda, while, contrary to expectation, damage was lower in full than in recessed mulches in Ntungamo. In both sites plants were larger in mulched than in unmulched systems with yield advantages of 18-27{\%}. We conclude that mulching is beneficial for banana production, but that there are no banana weevil management advantages to mulching away from the base of the banana mat. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A study was conducted in Uganda to determine the effect of mulching on banana (Musa spp. L.) weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), movement relative to pheromone-baited traps. Three treatments were used to create different mulching levels: banana without mulch (control), banana with thin mulch ({\textless} 6 cm thick), and banana with thick mulch (15 cm thick). Pheromone traps were placed in the plots and weevil trap catches were monitored. Weevil catches in pheromone traps from both mulched and unmulched plots were generally similar. The mulching level had no effect on the ratio of males to females recaptured. The numbers of weevils captured in pheromone traps were lower than in the wet season and was not influenced by mulch levels. Mulching levels had a limited influence on the numbers of weevils recaptured from different directions. The results generally indicate that mulching has no effect on weevil catches in phero- mone traps.},

Of the marked weevils, 62, 56 and 82{\%} respectively, were recovered in three trials. Most weevils were found in close association with either the banana mat (46–66{\%}) or with cut residues lying on the ground between the mats (24–31{\%}). Lesser numbers were found in the leaf mulch and in the top 3 cm of soil away from the mat.

@article{Gold2001a,
abstract = {The banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) is the most important insect pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). The larvae bore in the corm, reducing nutrient uptake and weakening the stability of the plant. Attack in newly planted banana stands can lead to crop failure. In established fields, weevil damage can result in reduced bunch weights, mat die-out and shortened stand life. Damage and yield losses tend to increase with time. This paper reviews the research on the taxonomy, distribution, biology, pest status, sampling methods, and integrated pest management (IPM) of banana weevil. Salient features of the weevil's biology include nocturnal activity, long life span, limited mobility, low fecundity, and slow population growth. The adults are free living and most often associated with banana mats and cut residues. They are attracted to their hosts by volatiles, especially following damage to the plant corm. Males produce an aggregation pheromone that is attractive to both sexes. Eggs are laid in the corm or lower pseudostem. The immature stages are all passed within the host plant, mostly in the corm. The weevil's biology creates sampling problems and makes its control difficult. Most commonly, weevils are monitored by trapping adults, mark and recapture methods and damage assessment to harvested or dead plants. Weevil pest status and control options reflect the type of banana being grown and the production system. Plantains and highland bananas are more susceptible to the weevil than dessert or brewing bananas. Banana production systems range from kitchen gardens and small, low-input stands to large-scale export plantations. IPM options for banana weevils include habitat management (cultural controls), biological control, host plant resistance, botanicals, and (in some cases) chemical control. Cultural controls have been widely recommended but data demonstrating their efficacy are limited. The most important are clean planting material in new stands, crop sanitation (especially destruction of residues), agronomic methods to improve plant vigour and tolerance to weevil attack and, possibly, trapping. Tissue culture plantlets, where available, assure the farmer with weevil-free material. Suckers may be cleaned by paring, hot water treatment and/or the applications of entomopathogens, neem, or pesticides. None of these methods assure elimination of weevils. Adult weevils may also invade from nearby plantations. As a result, the benefits of clean planting material may be limited to a few crop cycles. Field surveys suggest that reduced weevil populations may be associated with high levels of crop sanitation, yet definitive studies on residue management and weevil pest status are wanting. Trapping of adult weevils with pseudostem or corm traps can reduce weevil populations, but material and labour requirements may be beyond the resources of many farmers. The use of enhanced trapping with pheromones and kairomones is currently under study. A combination of clean planting material, sanitation, and trapping is likely to provide at least partial control of banana weevil. Classical biological control of banana weevil, using natural enemies from Asia, has so far been unsuccessful. Most known arthropod natural enemies are opportunistic, generalist predators with limited efficacy. Myrmicine ants have been reported to help control the weevil in Cuba, but their effects elsewhere are unknown. Microbial control, using entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes tend to be more promising. Effective strains of microbial agents are known but economic mass production and delivery systems need further development.},

In this paper, effects of potassium supply alone and combination of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers on population dynamics and density of cotton aphid Aphis gossypii (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were investigated during seedling stage in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-cotton production system. The results showed that high concentration of potassium fertilizer significantly reduced cotton aphid population density when nitrogen fertilizer was not used. Aphid population dynamics and density at peak time were obviously affected by the combination of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers in different rate, whereas different population dynamics of aphid were showed among different treatments. Compared with potassium fertilizer used alone, the same or significantly reduced aphid densities were observed in combination treatments of 120. kg/ha potassium with 108. kg/ha and 144. kg/ha nitrogen levels in both years. In addition, cotton aphid population density was significantly affected by interaction of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers in field experiments of two years, these results indicated that cotton aphid population density at seedling stage was suppressed by potassium fertilizer and the combination of potassium and nitrogen fertilizers in proper rate (K:N = 1:0.9 or 1:1.2. kg/ha). Suggesting that proper application of potassium and nitrogen fertilizers should be beneficial to controlling insect herbivores such as cotton aphid and plant growth at seedling stage of Bt-cotton field in Central China. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Farmers applied a wide range of additional resources to bananas including field crop residues (81{\%}), burned residues (3{\%}), on-farm manures (31{\%}), compost (16{\%}), external organic (17{\%}) and chemical (4{\%}) inputs. Of the organic inputs applied, bean trash (72{\%}), maize stover (68{\%}), cattle manure (45{\%}) and composts (18{\%}) were the most frequent. It was necessary to consider at least five different organic inputs to account for {\textgreater}90{\%} of farmer practices. Overall, intercropping was practised by 69{\%} of farmers. The six most encountered intercrops were, in decreasing order, beans, maize, cassava, Ficus natalensis, and fruit trees. Farmers applying banana stalks, field crop residues and cattle manures reported the largest bunch weights. Farmers relying upon banana stalks alone, banana stalks with field crop residues and either small livestock manure or domestic compost reported the lowest yields. It was concluded that farmers were developing strategies to resist fertility depletion, in part through better recycling of on-farm resources and intercropping but greater reliance upon external inputs may be required to ameliorate declining banana yields.},

abstract = {ubstantial evidence indicates that drought stress promotes outbreaks of plant-eating (phy-tophagous) fungi and insects. Obser-vations and experiments show that colonization success and prevalence of such fungi as root and stalk rots, stem cankers, and sometimes wilts and foliar diseases are much higher on water-stressed plants than on nor-mal plants (Schoeneweiss 1986). The evidence associating insects and drought is more circumstantial, con-sisting largely of observations that outbreaks around the world of such insects as bark beetles and leaf feeders (see Table 1) are typically preceded by unusually warm, dry weather. There is also a consistent, positive correla-tion between insect outbreaks and dry, nutrient-poor sites (Mattson and Haack 1987). To explain these phenomena, the following hypotheses have been pro-posed both separately and in combi-nation. Drought increases pathogen and insect survival and growth through elevated plant nutrient levels, especially nitrogen (Rhoades 1983, White 1984); lowered plant defenses (Rhoades 1983, 1985); and a more suitable physical environment (Begon 1983, Rhoades 1983).

abstract = {We conducted a controlled experiment to test the plant vigor and the plant stress hypotheses. The two hypotheses associate plant physiological conditions to insect feeding mode and performance. We exposed tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum, to different types of growing conditions: optimal (vigorous plants), resource based stress (water and/or nutrient deficit), and physical stress (punched hole in terminal leaflets). Plant performance, foliar nutritional value for insects and chemical defenses were analyzed after 14 d. These plants were offered to insects belonging to distinct feeding guilds: the silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia argentifolii, a phloem feeder; the leafminer, Liriomyza trifolii; and the corn earworm, Heliothis zea, a leaf chewing caterpillar. The experimental conditions generated a gradient of plant growth in the following order: optimal (vigorous) {\textgreater} control = hole punched {\textgreater} no fertilizer {\textgreater} no water {\textgreater} no water and no fertilizer. The last two treatments resulted in plants with poor nutritional value (based on {\%}water, C/N, {\%}N) and higher levels of defensive compounds (i.e., peroxidase and total phenolics) compared with control and the vigorous plants. Hole-punching neither affected plant growth nor any of the phytochemicals measured. In a choice experiment adult whitefly ovipositioning was not affected by either vigor or punching but was reduced on the other plants (P {\textless} 0.01). Leafminer feeding and oviposition and corn earworm larval growth rates were higher on the vigorous plants and lower on the punched, no fertilizer, no water, and no water and no fertilizer host plants (P {\textless} 0.01). Regardless of insect species or bioassay method, the results in the tomato system support the plant vigor hypothesis that predicts positive association between insect performance and plant growth. The results contradict the plant stress hypothesis that rank stressed plants as better hosts for insects. The mechanisms involved are a combination of poor nutritional value and chemical defenses. We demonstrate a negative association between plant growth and chemical defense. However, induced response triggered by hole-punching was not cost effective to the plants.},

abstract = {Physiological and ecological constraints play key roles in the evolution of plant growth patterns, especially in relation to defenses against herbivores. Phenotypic and life history theories are unified within the growth-differentiation balance (GDB) framework, forming an integrated system of theories explaining and predicting patterns of plant defense and competitive interactions in ecological and evolutionary time. Plant activity at the cellular level can be classified as growth (cell division and enlargement) of differentiation (chemical and morphological changes leading to cell maturation and specialization). The GDB hypothesis of plant defense is premised upon a physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes. The trade-off between growth and defense exists because secondary metabolism and structural reinforcement are physiologically constrained in dividing and enlarging cells, and because they divert resources from the production of new leaf area. Hence the dilemma of plants: They must grow fast enough to compete, yet maintain the defenses necessary to survive in the presence of pathogens and herbivores. The physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes interacts with herbivory and plant-plant competition to manifest itself as a genetic trade-off between growth and defense in the evolution of plant life history strategies. Evolutionary theories of plant defense are reviewed. We also extend a standard growth rate model by separating its ecological and evolutionary components, and formalizing the role of competition in the evolution of plant defense. We conclude with a conceptual model of the evolution of plant defense in which plant physiological trade-offs interact with the abiotic environment, competition and herbivory.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Foliar analysis by the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) pinpoints K and Mg as the most limiting nutrients. This study tested the effects of K and Mg additions on plant performance and weevil damage for 2.75 yr, at Buligwe in central Uganda and Muyogo in southwest Uganda. All treatments received 25 kg P ha-1 and 100 kg N ha-1 annually, while K and Mg were applied (kg ha-1) at 0 K-0 Mg, 100 K-0 Mg, 100 K-25 Mg and 100 K-50 Mg. Fresh fruit yields (Mg ha-1 yr-1) ranged from 3.2 to 5.0 at Buligwe and 14.4 to 18.9 at Muyogo, with similar treatment trends at both sites. The 100 K-0 Mg treatment produced higher yields than no-K control (p=0.022 for the combined dataset). Yields with K+Mg tended to be lower than with K only, though not significantly different. Foliar nutrient concentrations were little affected by treatments, but varied substantially among sample dates. With increasing cumulative rainfall between foliar samplings, foliar P declined (p=0.077), K declined (ns), and Ca and Mg increased (p=0.02 to 0.03). Weevil damage was higher at Buligwe, but was little affected by K and Mg treatments at either site.},

abstract = {Providing a fast growing world population with sufficient food while preserving ecological and energy resources of our planet is one of the biggest challenges in this century. Optimized management of chemical fertilizers and pesticides will be essential for achieving sustainability of intensive farming and requires both empirical data from field trials and advanced fundamental understanding of the molecular processes controlling plant growth. Genes involved in plant responses to nutrient deficiency and pathogen/herbivore attack have been identified, but we are lacking information about the cross-talk between signalling pathways when plants are exposed to a combination of abiotic and biotic stress factors. The focus of this review is on the relationship between the potassium status of plants and their susceptibility to pathogens and herbivorous insects. We combine field evidence on potassiumG{\c{C}}{\^{o}}disease interaction with existing knowledge on metabolic and physiological factors that could explain such interaction, and present new data on metabolite profiles and hormonal pathways from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The latter provides evidence that facilitated entry and development of pathogens or insects in(to) potassium-deficient plants as a result of physical and metabolic changes is counteracted by an increased defence. A genetic approach should now be applied to establish a causal relationship between disease susceptibility on the one hand and individual enzymatic and signal components on the other. Once identified, these can be used to design agricultural strategies that support the nutritional status of the crops while exploiting their inherent potential for defence},

abstract = {In banana on-farm studies in the East African Highlands, quantification of production has been difficult because plants are at different stages of development at any given time. Production is continuous and quantification would therefore require permanent presence of an observer. Hence, most on-farm surveys have resorted to estimations from farmers or 'experts' through recall or visual qualitative observations. These methods are highly inaccurate. This study aims to develop and validate allometric relationships for quantitative estimation of bunch weights, based on rapid, inexpensive and non-destructive methods of data collection that take into consideration genotypic, spatial and developmental variability. The study was conducted in 179 farmer fields in central, south, southwest, and east Uganda. Bunch weights were estimated through linear regression with log-transformed girth of pseudostem at base and 1m, number of hands, and number of fingers in the lower row of the second lowest hand. The number of hands and fingers relate to the potential sink size (i.e. bunch), and the girth at base and 1m were used as a proxy for pseudostem volume, which relates to the potential of the plant to fill the sink. Bunch weight was significantly (P ??? 0.001) and positively (R2 = 0.73) related to log-transformed pseudostem volume, and number of hands and fingers. When data were partitioned and regressed, regression coefficients did not differ significantly for cultivars (i.e. Enyeru, Kibuzi, Nakabululu and Nakitembe), developmental stages (flowering, early fruiting, late fruiting and full maturity), regions (central, south, southwest and east Uganda), foliar and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. Data partitioning improved the accuracy of prediction significantly for different cultivars, regions, and foliar Ca, but not for bunch developmental stages, foliar N, P, K and Mg and soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations. However, the residuals of all the regressions of partitioned data correlated highly (R2 between 0.92 and 1.00) to those of the regression based on pooled data. On validation of the regression based on pooled data, the bias (-9.97{\%}) and modeling efficiency statistic (0.64), suggested that predictions were not always accurate. Still, the total predicted bunch weights were higher than the observed bunch weight by only 2{\%}. This study therefore concludes that the regression derived using pooled data is suitable for on-farm prediction of bunch weight, for the East African Highland cooking banana, regardless of genotypic, developmental and spatial variations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Banana is the primary food crop in Uganda, but yields are low due to a complex of abiotic and biotic constraints. However, quantitative information on the importance, interactions, and geographic distribution of yields and constraints is scanty. We monitored yields, biotic and abiotic constraints in 159 plots in Central, South and Southwest Uganda in 2006-2007. About half the plots were on-farm demonstrations that received fertilizer (average 71N, 8P, 32 K kg ha-1 year-1) through a development project, the rest were ordinary farmer fields (i.e. controls). Fresh banana yields in controls were significantly (P ??? 0.05) higher in Southwest (20 t ha-1 year-1) compared with Central (12 t ha-1 year-1) and South (10 t ha-1 year-1). Demonstrations yielded 3-10 t ha-1 year-1 more than controls. Yield losses were calculated using the boundary line approach. In Central, yield losses, expressed as percentage of attainable yield, were mainly attributed to pests (nematodes 10{\%} loss, weevils - 6{\%}) and suboptimal crop management (mulch 25{\%}). In South, poor soil quality (pH - 21{\%}, SOM - 13{\%}, N-total - 13{\%}, and Clay - 11{\%}) and suboptimal crop management (weeds - 20{\%}) were the main constraints. In Southwest, suboptimal crop management (mulch 16{\%}), poor soil quality (K/(Ca + Mg) - 11{\%}) and low rainfall (5{\%}) were the primary constraints. The study revealed that biotic stresses (i.e. pests, weeds) are particularly important in Central, whereas abiotic stresses (i.e. nutrient deficiencies, drought) dominate in South and Southwest. This study concludes that (i) technologies currently available allow farmers to double yields and (ii) past research efforts have mistakenly neglected abiotic constraints. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of half the recommended rates of mineral fertilizers and organic mulch on banana yield, soil and foliar nutrient status, soil water and pest damage in the central region of Uganda. The study was conducted in a four-year old banana plantation infested with weevils. Treatments consisted of mineral fertilizer alone, mulch alone, a combination of mulch with fertilizer, and a control (no mulch from outside the plot, or mineral fertilizer applied). Fruit yield was generally low (mean of 7.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1) and increases above the control ranged from 1.1 to 2.0 Mg ha-1 yr-1. Banana yield was significantly higher in the sole mulch treatment than in the control. However, there were no significant differences in yield among the treatments that received external inputs. Thus, there was no demonstrable yield advantage of combining mineral fertilizer with mulch. At the end of the trial, soil K concentrations in the two treatments that were mulched, were almost twice those of the control, but this difference was not statistically significant. Concentrations of Ca and Mg did not differ with treatment. Soil available P significantly increased when mineral fertilizer and organic mulch were combined. Treatments that received organic mulch were lower in foliar concentrations of N and Mg, and higher in K. Soil water content was greater in the surface soil layer in the treatments that received mulch, presumably due to less surface run-off and evaporation, since there was no change in surface soil porosity. The effect of organic and inorganic amendments had no impact on weevil damage, which remained above 5{\%} at the end of the trial. We conclude that where weevil damage is over 5{\%} of the cross section near the collar, banana production may not be economically increased through use of either mineral fertilizer and/or organic mulch.},

abstract = {Banana is the most important food crop in Uganda. However, there has been a decline in productivity, attributed to declining soil fertility, drought, pests and diseases and crop management factors. This study aimed to explore the possibility of increasing yields through the use of fertilizer and mulch, and to evaluate the benefits of these inputs across the major banana producing regions in Uganda. This study was carried out in 179 smallholder plots in Central, South, Southwest and East Uganda in 2006/7. Half of the plots were 'demonstration plots' of an agricultural development project, while the other half were neighboring farmer plots that acted as 'control'. Demonstration plots received mineral fertilizer (100{\%} of plots), averaging 71 N, 8 P, 32 K kg ha-1 yr-1 and external mulch from grass and crop residues (64{\%} of plots), whereas control plots received no mineral fertilizer and little external mulch (26{\%} of plots). Demonstration plots had significantly (P{\textless}=0.05) higher yields than control plot in Central, South and Southwest, but average yield increases varied from 4.8 t ha-1 yr-1 (Southwest) to 8.0 (Central), and 10.0 (South). Average weevil corm damage (3{\%}) and nematode-induced root necrosis (7{\%}) was low and similar for both plot types, so yield increases could only be explained by the use of fertilizer and mulch. The highest demonstration plot yield increases were observed where fertilizer addressed key nutrient deficiencies identified using the compositional nutrient diagnosis approach. Farm gate bunch prices declined from 0.17 (Central Uganda) to 0.07 USD kg-1 (Southwest Uganda). Consequently, average marginal rate of return (MRR) of fertilizer and mulch use ranged from 0.1 (Southwest) to 5.8 (Central). The technologies were likely to be acceptable to farmers (MRR{\textgreater}=1.00) up to 160 km away from the capital. Fertilizer use is likely to be acceptable in all regions (MRR=0.7-9.4) if local fertilizer prices of 2006/7 (average USD 0.56 kg-1 of fertilizer) declined by 50{\%}. Doubling of fertilizer prices is likely to make fertilizer use unacceptable beyond 100 km away from the capital. The study concludes that there is scope for increased input use in banana systems in Uganda, but that regional variations in crop response, input/output prices, and price fluctuations have to be taken into account.},

abstract = {Poor yields of East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EAHB) on smallholder farms have often been attributed to problems of poor soil fertility. We measured the effects of mineral fertilizers on crop performance at two sites over two to three crop cycles; Kawanda in central Uganda and Ntungamo in southwest Uganda. Fertilizers were applied at rates of 0N-50P-600K, 150N-50P-600K, 400N-0P-600K, 400N-50P-0K, 400N-50P-250K and 400N-50P-600K kg ha-1 yr-1. In addition 60Mg-6Zn-0.5Mo-1B kg ha-1 yr-1 was applied to all treatments, with the exception of the control plots which received no fertilizer. Fresh bunch mass and yield increased with successive cycles. Yield increases above the control ranged from 3.1 to 6.2 kg bunch-1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 11.5 kg bunch-1) and 2.2-11.2 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (average yield for all treatments 15.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1) at Kawanda, compared with 12.4-16.0 kg bunch-1 (average bunch weight for all treatments 14.7 kg bunch-1) and 7.0-29.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (average yield for all treatments 17.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1) at Ntungamo. The limiting nutrients at both sites were in the order K {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} N. Potassium, N and P foliar nutrient mass fractions were below previously established Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) norms, with the smallest K mass fractions observed in the best yielding plots at Ntungamo. Total nutrient uptakes (K {\textgreater} N {\textgreater} P) were higher at Ntungamo as compared with Kawanda, probably due to better soil moisture availability and root exploration of the soil. Average N, P and K conversion efficiencies for two crop cycles at both sites amounted to 49.2 kg finger DM kg-1 N, 587 kg finger DM kg-1 P and 10.8 kg finger DM kg-1 K. Calibration results of the model QUEFTS using data from Ntungamo were reasonable (R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 648 kg ha-1). Using the measured soil chemical properties and yield data from an experiment at Mbarara in southwest Uganda, the calibrated QUEFTS model predicted yields well (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 562 kg ha-1). We conclude that banana yields can be increased by use of mineral fertilizers, but fertilizer recovery efficiencies need to improve substantially before promoting wide-scale adoption. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although drought stress has been identified among the production constraints of East African highland bananas (Musa spp., AAA-EA genome), no quantitative data were available to support this assumption. This study uses data from three on-station fertilizer trials (5-6 cycles) in Central and Southwest Uganda to quantify the effect of drought stress on banana production and explore possible interactions with nutrient availability. Production data were collected at individual plant basis from 1996 to 2002 in one trial and from 2004 to 2009 in two trials. Cumulative rainfall in the 12 months before harvest (CRF12) was computed per plant from daily rainfall measurements. Average bunch weight ranged from 8.0 to 21.9 kg between trials and cycles and was 8-28{\%} less in dry (CRF12{\textless}=905 mm) than in normal (905{\textless}CRF12{\textless}=1365 mm) rainfall periods. Linear relations were observed between CRF12 and maximum bunch weight over the whole range of observed CRF12 (500-1750 mm), whereby every 100 mm decline in rainfall caused maximum bunch weight losses of 1.5-3.1 kg or 8-10{\%}. Optimum annual rainfall for East African highland bananas may thus be well above 1200-1300 mm yr-1 as suggested earlier. Relative drought-induced yield losses were independent of soil fertility. Absolute losses on fertile/fertilized soils were similar to those recorded in well fertilized irrigation studies in Latin America. Our study suggests that drought-induced yield losses in areas of the East African highlands with annual rainfall {\textless}1100 mm are perhaps as high as 20-65{\%} compared to the wetter areas in this region. To improve productivity of smallholder banana farmers in Africa, more attention should be given to research geared towards improved water/drought stress management.},

abstract = {Major constraints to banana (Musa spp., ge-nome group AAA) production, a dietary staple for over 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, are pest infestations, poor nutrition and inadequate water. Al-though mulch can improve soil water and nutrient status, many farmers believe it also promotes the proliferation of banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus), one of the most serious banana pests. In this study, we evaluated the effects of mulch location (mulch to base of banana pseudostem; mulch recessed 1 m from the pseudostem) on banana weevil, soil and plant nutrient status, soil water, and banana growth and development. After 3 years, the fully mulched plots had significantly more soil Ca and Mg than plots that did not receive mulch. Banana foliar K concentration was significantly higher in both mulch treatments (full and recessed) than in the control (no mulch) plots. The mulched plots had greater recharge after rainfall events and higher soil water contents during dry periods due to increased infiltration in the mulched plots. However, the mulched plots also exhibited signif-icantly higher banana weevil densities and greater plant damage than the control plots. There was no difference in weevil damage with mulch location, although weevil density was higher in the fully mulched plots throughout most of the trial. Despite greater weevil damage, the treatments that were mulched yielded significantly heav-ier bunches. Hence the effects of the mulch on soil water infiltration and banana foliar nutrient status outweighed the detrimental effects of banana weevil damage.},

abstract = {Banana (Musa AAA) production is declining in central Uganda. A decline in soil fertility is often cited as one of the causes of the declining production. From 1996 to 1998, we studied banana yield responses to N and K fertilization at three sites in Uganda, where plantations ranged in age from 8 to 50 years. Phosphorus was applied to all treatments at 25 kg ha-1, while N and K were applied (kg ha-1) at 0N-0K, 0N-100K, 100N-0K, 100N- 100K, and 100N-200K. Fresh fruit yields ranged from 4 to 67 Mg ha-1 yr-1. At one site the yield response to 100N-100K fertilization was significant (p {\textless} 0.01). The other sites showed positive but non-significant yield responses to N or NK fertilization. Economic analysis indicated that fertilizer use would be profitable only at the single site with significant yield increases. This site had negligible banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar)) and nematode (Radopholus similis; Helicotylenchus multicinctus) populations whereas the other sites were characterized by either severe nematode or weevil pressure. Fertilizer did not affect the damage caused by either nematodes or weevils. The best predictor of yield (p{\textless} 0.001, r2 = 0.75) was the number of functional leaves during anthesis. Measured soil nutrient parameters were highly variable but fell within sufficiency ranges. Foliar N contents were near diagnostic norms, but K levels fell below them, even when yields were satisfactory, suggesting that norms developed from other regions may not be suitable for Uganda. We conclude that in established plantations soil nutrient status is but one, and often a secondary, factor in the decline of banana yields in the central region of Uganda. Pest and disease infestations that result in reduced plantation productivity will need to be addressed before fertilizer use is likely to make a significant improvement in banana fruit yields.},

abstract = {Banana production landscapes in the African Great Lakes Region (AGLR) have been under immense pressure from Xanthomonas wilt (XW) disease over the past two decades. XW, first reported on banana in central Uganda and eastern DR Congo in 2001, has since spread to the entire AGLR. XW is currently spreading westwards from hot spots in eastern DR Congo highlands, putting the plantain (Musa AAB genome) belt of central and west Africa at risk. In-depth understanding of the key variables responsible for disease spread, current hotspots, and vulnerable landscapes is crucial for disease early warning and management. We mapped aggregated disease distribution and hotspots in the AGLR and identified vulnerable landscapes across African banana production zones. Available data on disease prevalence collected over 11 years was regressed against environmental and expert developed covariates to develop the AGLR XW hotspots map. For the Africa-wide risk map, precipitation, distance to hotspots, degree of trade in fresh banana products, production zone interconnectedness and banana genotype composition were used as covariates. In the AGLR, XW was mainly correlated to precipitation and disease/banana management. Altitude and temperature had unexpectedly low effects, possibly due to an overriding impact of tool-mediated spread which is part of the management covariate. In the AGLR, the eastern part of DR Congo was a large hotspot with highest vulnerability. Apart from endemic zones in the AGLR and Ethiopia, northern Mozambique was perceived as a moderate risk zone mainly due to the predominance of ‘Bluggoe' (Musa ABB type) which is highly susceptible to insect-vectored transmission. Presence of XW hotspots (e.g. eastern DR Congo) and vulnerable areas with low (e.g. north-western Tanzania) or no disease (e.g. Congo basin, western DR Congo and northern Mozambique) pressure suggest key areas where proactive measures e.g. quarantines and information sharing on XW diagnosis, epidemiology, and control could be beneficial.},

abstract = {1. The nitrogen limitation hypothesis posits that phytophagous insects benefit from nitrogen enrichment of their host plants through a reduction of the concentration of toxic compounds and an increase of free amino acids and proteins. However, species' response to nitrogen enrichment varies substantially and high nitrogen levels are associated with population decline, suggesting there are major costs to feeding on nitrogen-rich host plants. 2. To test the hypothesis that larval growth performance is maximal at intermediate nitrogen enrichment, nitrogen levels were measured in 18 populations of the host plant of Lycaena helle, a specialist butterfly inhabiting nutrient-poor wet meadows. The nitrogen content of host plants was then modified to mirror average natural nitrogen levels (C), highest field-recorded levels (T1), and levels higher than those observed across our study populations (T2). 3. Caterpillars fed with T1 leaves had a greater maximum body mass than caterpillars of the C group because of their improved food assimilation during the early stages of their development. Caterpillars of C and T2 groups had similar growth patterns but high nitrogen content had detrimental effects, as caterpillars fed with T2 leaves had a slower ingestion rate than C and T1 groups. 4. Quantifying the fitness consequences of these changes in growth performance is necessary to fully understand the implications of nitrogen enrichment for L. helle (rapid growth may result in fitness costs). However, conservation plans for this emblematic glacial relict species should also consider the preservation of its host plant quality to ensure its persistence.},

A holistic systems approach to pest management recognizes disciplinary integration. However, a critical under-representation of nematol-ogy expertise is a pivotal shortcoming, especially given the magnitude of the threat nematodes pose under more intensified systems.

abstract = {East African highland bananas (EAHB) were regarded as sterile. Their screening for female fertility with “Calcutta 4” as male parent revealed that 37 EAHB were fertile. This was the foundation for the establishment of the EAHB crossbreeding programs by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) in Uganda in the mid-1990s. The aim of this study was to assess the progress and efficiency of the EAHB breeding program at IITA, Sendusu in Uganda. Data on pollinations, seeds generated and germinated, plus hybrids selected between 1995 and 2015 were analyzed. Pollination success and seed germination percentages for different cross combinations were calculated. The month of pollination did not result in significantly different (P = 0.501) pollination success. Musa acuminata subsp. malaccensis accession 250 had the highest pollination success (66.8{\%}), followed by the cultivar “Rose” (66.6{\%}) among the diploid males. Twenty-five EAHB out of 41 studied for female fertility produced up to 305 seeds per pollinated bunch, and were therefore deemed fertile. The percentage of seed germination varied among crosses: 26{\%} for 2x × 4x, 23{\%} for 2x × 2x, 11{\%} for 3x × 2x, and 7{\%} for 4x × 2x. Twenty-seven NARITA hybrids (mostly secondary triploids ensuing from the 4x × 2x) were selected for further evaluation in the East African region. One so far –“NARITA 7”– was officially released to farmers in Uganda. Although pollination of EAHB can be conducted throughout the year, the seed set and germination is low. Thus, further research on pollination conditions and optimization of embryo culture protocols should be done to boost seed set and embryo germination, respectively. More research in floral biology and seed germination as well as other breeding strategies are required to increase the efficiency of the EAHB breeding program.},

abstract = {Nutrition concerns the chemicals required by organism for its growth, tissue maintenance, reproduction and necessary to maintain these functions. It may determine resistance or susceptibility to pests. Among several plant nutrients, only 17 are essential for proper growth and development of plants and each nutrient plays important role in their growth. These nutrients are required by insects for their growth, tissue maintenance, reproduction and energy. They fulfill their requirements through feeding on plants. Nitrogen has positive effects on individual insect performance, probably due to deposition-induced improvements in host plant chemistry. These improvements include increased nitrogen and decreased carbon-based defensive compound concentrations. Potassium provides high resistance against insect-pests. High levels of potassium enhance secondary compound metabolism, reduce carbohydrate accumulation and plant damage from insect pests. Phosphorus also decreases the host suitability to various insect-pests. Secondary macronutrients and micronutrients like calcium, zinc and sulphur also reduce the pest populations. Among mineral elements, silicon is involved in plant resistance against insect pest damage. The indirect effects of fertilization practices acting through changes in the nutrient composition of the crop have been reported to influence plant resistance to many insect pests. The need for more healthful foods is stimulating the development of techniques to increase plant resistance to phytophagous insects. 1. Introduction Terrestrial eukaryotic biodiversity is dominated by plants and the animals that eat them, the majority of which are insects (Simpson et al. 2015) [23]. Insect-pests are threat to agricultural productivity. They affect the crop yield, quality and aesthetic value. Nutritional quality of plant tissue is one of the main characteristics of host plant selection by phytophagous insects (Bernays and Chapman 1994) [6]. It has a substantial impact on the predisposition of plants to insect-pests. Unlike in human nutrition where the effect of nutrition on "health" has gained considerable importance, the implementation of "healthy" nutrition to improve resistance and tolerance of plants lags its potential. Plant nutrition is a study that deals with plants' need for certain chemical elements including their specific and interactive effects on all aspects of plant growth and development, their availability, absorption, transport, and utilization. These chemical elements are referred to as plant nutrients. A plant nutrient is a chemical element that is essential for plant growth and reproduction. Essential element is a term often used to identify a plant nutrient. Plant nutrients can be classified on the basis of mineral composition, nutrients concentration and on the basis of their physiological functions. Besides carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which plants obtain from carbon dioxide and water, 14 nutrients are recognized as essential viz., primary macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), secondary macronutrients (calcium, magnesium and sulphur) and micronutrients (iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, molybdenum, chlorine and nickel) for growth of plants. The relative availability of various nutrients affects the growth and fitness of herbivores, whose biomass generally contains much greater concentrations of elements as compared to plants (Boswell et al. 2008) [7]. Qualitative nutritional requirements of insects include carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals and vitamins. Insects get their nutrients from plants through feeding.},

In modern agriculture, the most critical problem for increasing yield and developing sustainable agriculture is sufficient fertilizers supply and
successful crop protection against herbivores. Herbivores are sensitive to alternation in host plant nutrition. Nutrient enrichment from agricultural and atmospheric sources has the potential to alter plant–insect interactions via changes in plant growth and defense. Optimized management of chemical fertilizers will be essential for achieving sustainability of intensive farming. If integrated crop production is to be extensively used in the future, a greater understanding of relationships among soil characteristics, fertilization practices, plant nutrient content and the ability of pests to reduce yield or crop quality will be required. [Adapt to own, cite [@Bala2018]

Application of potassium and nitrogen fertilizers should be beneficial to controlling insect herbivores such as cotton aphid and plant growth at seedling stage of Bt-cotton field in Central China [@Ai2011]

Proper fertilization is necessary to give the plants a certain level of resistance against pests. Primary pest defense of plants like physical and biochemical properties can be enhanced by balanced fertilization with plant nutrients[@Bala2018]. 
However, balance mightn ot necessary mean equal amounts of fertilisers. In banana specifically, equal amounts actually increase pest damage[add{\_}citation].},

abstract = {Banana (Musa AAA) and plantain (Musa AAB) are important dietary staples for over 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. Banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) and nematodes (Radopholus similis, Helicotylenchus multicinctus) are often the largest constraints to production. Leguminous crops in the genera Canavalia, Mucuna and Tephrosia have been reported as having repellent or insecticidal properties. We assessed: weevil and nematode populations and damage; banana growth and development; soil and foliar nutrient concentrations; and soil moisture status in banana intercropped with three legumes (Canavalia ensiformis, Mucuna pruriens and Tephrosia vogelii). The research took place at Kawanda, Uganda, on a field site infested with weevils and nematodes. The legume intercrops did not affect weevil populations or damage. The legumes also provided no benefit in terms of nematode control; in fact, banana root necrosis was higher in the T. vogelii intercrop than in the banana monoculture. Banana fruit yield was not adversely affected by the legume intercrops. The low yield noted across treatments was attributed to the high level of damage by the weevils and the nematodes. Significantly more NO3-N accumulated from 0- to 0.3-m depth in the M. pruriens intercrop than in the other treatments. There was no treatment difference in soil moisture. In summary, there was no significant advantage in banana production associated with the legume intercrops. However, the lack of a significant difference in banana fruit production between the monoculture and the intercrops suggests that land use efficiency may be increased by incorporating food and or/fodder legumes into the banana cropping system.},

abstract = {Objective: Banana weevil has been reported as a serious pest on banana, an important staple and food crop in the east African region. This study was conducted to establish the impact of weevil infestation on Musa spp. growth traits during the first crop cycle. Methodology and results: Experiments were carried out using eight Musa spp. comprising of the East African highland bananas (Musa spp, AAA-EAHB group); Mpologoma, Lwadungu, Nakitembe, Mbwazirume and Kibuzi; the dessert banana Sukali Ndiizi (AAB); the plantain Gonja (AAB) and the beer banana Kayinja (ABB). All genotypes were assessed at bunch maturity. Weevil build-up and subsequent damage to the banana corms during the first crop cycle was low, presenting an average cross-sectional corm damage of 1.2{\%}. Consequently, hardly any significant negative effects on yield and growth traits were observed. Conclusion and application of findings: The results suggest that several ratoon cycles may be required in order to achieve a high weevil population density build-up to cause substantial reduction in yield and plant growth. The results also show that genotypes with a 'B' genome such as Sukali Ndiizi and Kayinja are more tolerant to banana weevils than genotypes with only 'A' genomes.},

abstract = {Low yields of East African highland bananas (Musa spp. AAA-EA) are often attributed to poor and declining soil fertility, which outweighs other biophysical factors and management practices. We investigated the influence of planting density on nutrient mass fractions and nutrient imbalance indices in bananas under small-scale, low-input systems using the compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND) approach. Boundary line functions were developed to identify yield limiting factors and quantify their contribution to the yield gap. Soil, plant, yield and water data were collected in plant density experiments conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (i.e. Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall but low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility). Effects of site×cultivar and site×density on bunch yield were significant (p{\textless}0.05). Annual yields (tha-1yr-1) ranged from 6.1 to 9.2 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0 at Ruhengeri. Similar trends were registered for the above ground dry matter yield. CND indices showed that K, Mg and P were the most deficient elements in areas with low inherent soil fertility (Kibungo and Rubona). The yield gap analysis also confirmed that K was the most limiting factor, contributing to a predicted yield gap of 55.3{\%} at Kibungo while P and Mg collectively contributed to a 35{\%} yield gap at Rubona. An increase in plant density resulted in an increase in average yield gap from 45.6 to 70.2{\%} at Kibungo, whilst the average yield gap decreased significantly with increases in plant density from 47.5 to 30.2{\%} at Rubona and 76.6 to 53.7{\%} at Ruhengeri. The study confirmed that soil fertility is a more limiting factor than water, but both CND norms and boundary line analysis showed that predicted yield gaps seem to be higher for plant density than soil fertility. Therefore, plant density management is an entry point to optimize yield of East African highland bananas. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Highland bananas are an important staple food in East Africa, but there is little information on their physiology and growth patterns. This makes it difficult to identify opportunities for yield improvement. We studied allometric relationships by evaluating different phenological stages of highland banana growth for use in growth assessment, understanding banana crop physiology and yield prediction. Pared corms of uniform size (cv. Kisansa) were planted in a pest-free field in Kawanda (central Uganda), supplied with fertilizers and irrigated during dry periods. In addition, tissue-cultured plants (cv. Kisansa) were planted in an adjacent field and in Ntungamo (southwest Uganda), with various nutrient addition treatments (of N, P, K, Mg, S, Zn, B and Mo). Plant height, girth at base, number of functional leaves and phenological stages were monitored monthly. Destructive sampling allowed derivation of allometric relationships to describe leaf area and biomass distribution in plants throughout the growth cycle. Individual leaf area was estimated as LA (m2)=length (m) x maximum lamina width (m) x 0.68. Total plant leaf area (TLA) was estimated as the product of the measured middle leaf area (MLA) and the number of functional leaves. MLA was estimated as MLA (m2)=-0.404+0.381 height (m)+0.411 girth (m). A light extinction coefficient (k=0.7) was estimated from photosynthetically active radiation measurements in a 1.0 m grid over the entire day. The dominant dry matter (DM) sinks changed from leaves at 1118 degrees C days (47{\%} of DM) and 1518 degrees C days (46{\%} of DM), to the stem at 2125 degrees C days (43{\%} of DM) and 3383 degrees C days (58{\%} of DM), and finally to the bunch at harvest (4326 degrees C days) with 53{\%} of DM. The allometric relationship between above-ground biomass (AGB in kg DM) and girth (cm) during the vegetative phase followed a power function, AGB=0.0001 (girth)2.35 (R2=0.99), but followed exponential functions at flowering, AGB=0.325 e0.036(girth) (R2=0.79) and at harvest, AGB=0.069 e0.068(girth) (R2=0.96). Girth at flowering was a good parameter for predicting yields with R2=0.7 (cv. Mbwazirume) and R2=0.57 (cv. Kisansa) obtained between actual and predicted bunch weights. This article shows that allometric relationship can be derived and used to assess biomass production and for developing banana growth models, which can help breeders and agronomists to further exploit the crop's potential.},
